Years earlier, Fung was disabled by his teammate Hung (Patrick Tse), who now owns Team Evil. Eventually, Sing is reunited with his brothers, after Fung convinces them to use their kung-fu skills to play soccer. &quot;Soccer&quot; is so unabashed in its cheesiness that it could be spread on crackers.

Released in Russia in 1998, its story line &#151; a group of hearty peasant types from the Urals track down the corrupt officials who sold their former collective farm to an oil oligarch &#151;  reportedly proved to be so incendiary that there were calls for the film to be banned.   Shooting in a stark black-and-white meant to evoke the socialist realist filmmaking of the 1930's, Pyotr Lutski is making a nostalgic appeal to an era that does not seem entirely worthy of such romantic reconsideration.  But at the same time, he has built so much postmodern irony into his film that it's hard to know where satire stops and sincerity begins.  Is Mr. Lutski endorsing his protagonists' brutal tactics or is he making fun of them?  Are they admirable role models from Russia's lost past or are they idiot thugs still employing the tactics of Stalin's secret police?  Ultimately these questions are unanswerable, which makes &quot;The Outskirts&quot; both a challenging film and a frustrating one. &#151; Dave Kehr", "multimedia": null}, {"headline": "In the West Bank and Gaza, Getting From Place to Place Is More Stop Than Go", "publication_date": "2004-04-01", "byline": "Stephen Holden", "critics_pick": 0, "date_updated": "2016-03-30 07:21:46", "opening_date": null, "display_title": "Checkpoint", "link": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9905E1DF1439F932A35757C0A9629C8B63", "suggested_link_text": "Read the New York Times Review of Checkpoint", "type": "article"}, "mpaa_rating": "", "summary_short": "", "multimedia": null}, {"headline": "A Buddhist Observes Humanity With Sharp and Stern Eyes", "publication_date": "2004-03-31", "byline": "A.
