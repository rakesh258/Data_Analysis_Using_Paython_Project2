In the course of Bresson's short tale, both Marie and Balthazar will endure a crucible of suffering &#151; she at the rough hands of a punk in a black leather jacket, the donkey at the equally rough hands of various vicious masters. The critic J. Hoberman has observed that &quot;Balthazar&quot; is about a donkey in about the same way that &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; is about a whale, but it is also true that this is a story about an animal. Inspired by a passage from Dostoevsky's &quot;Idiot,&quot; Bresson makes Balthazar the moral center of his film, perhaps because, unlike Marie and the rest of the men and women in this fallen world, the donkey doesn't need to die to achieve grace. (It's worth noting that Bresson used a Schubert Sonata as &quot;a kind of language for the donkey's soul.&quot;) Over the years, some critics have classified Bresson's work as unapproachable, even punishing. For these professional philistines the idea that movies can be serious, more than tricks and trashy entertainment, is apparently anathema. Don't you believe it: &quot;Au Hasard Balthazar&quot; is a masterpiece of the art, but a masterpiece that stirs the heart and soul as much as the mind. &#151; Manohla Dargis", "multimedia": null}, {"headline": "Event, An (Movie)", "publication_date": "1970-02-17", "byline": "ROGER GREENSPUN", "critics_pick": 0, "date_updated": "2016-03-30 07:27:39", "opening_date": null, "display_title": "An Event", "link": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E02E5DD133FE53BBC4F52DFB466838B669EDE", "suggested_link_text": "Read the New York Times Review of An Event", "type": "article"}, "mpaa_rating": "", "summary_short": "", "multimedia": null}, {"headline": "...Tick...Tick...Tick (Movie)", "publication_date": "1970-02-13", "byline": "HOWARD THOMPSON", "critics_pick": 0, "date_updated": "2016-03-30 06:55:48", "opening_date": "1970-01-09", "display_title": "Tick, Tick, Tick", "link": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9A01E2DD1F39EE34BC4B52DFB466838B669EDE", "suggested_link_text": "Read the New York Times Review of Tick, Tick, Tick", "type": "article"}, "mpaa_rating": "G", "summary_short": "Black sheriff, Southern tensions, standard roundup of Southern bigots.
