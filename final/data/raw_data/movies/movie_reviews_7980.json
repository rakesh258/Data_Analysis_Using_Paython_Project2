Keanu Reeves, perhaps worried that he was showing too much range, has purged himself of all expression apart from a worried frown and a sorrowful grimace, which is mirrored in the face of Carrie-Anne Moss, who returns as Trinity. The salient distinction of the human remnants in Zion, apart from their earth-toned natural-fiber fashions, has been the capacity for love, a word much spoken in this movie. But their ranks, in spite of the presence of fine actors like Laurence Fishburne, Harry Lennix and Harold Perrineau, become more robotic with every passing scene. The sole exception is Jada Pinkett Smith as the daredevil pilot Niobe, who brings a touch of bad-girl B-movie attitude into the humorless subterranean gloom. It is not altogether worthless: the Wachowski Brothers still know how to stage an action sequence, and there are some scenes that have a quiet, mysterious beauty.

As Coleman Silk, a Classics professor chased from his job after being absurdly accused of racism, Anthony Hopkins has a loose, mellow exuberance that almost persuades you to overlook a basic, insurmountable improbability, namely that his character is a black man who has spent most of his adulthood passing for white. Nicole Kidman, playing Coleman's abused, impoverished and much younger lover, is almost as hard to believe, but her performance is nonetheless serious and unaffected. Some of the best work comes in smaller parts: Wentworth Miller as young Coleman; Anna Deavere Smith as his mother; and especially Jacinda Barrett as the great love of his youth. The movie has many memorable, moving scenes \u2014 as well as a few awkward and embarrassing ones \u2014 but it never coheres either dramatically or intellectually, largely because it lacks a way to approximate the novel's unifying force, which is Mr. Roth s unruly, passionate and brilliant voice. \u2014 A.

The pieces of this musical shown in &quot;Morning Sun&quot; are so fulsomely straightforward that being denied a chance to see it in its entirety feels like a form of deprivation. That is, until the directors focus on the adults who were indoctrinated under the firm, unambiguous hand of Mao. Then deprivation is defined in truly horrific terms. One of the grown-ups describes the Revolution in grimly elegant fashion: &quot;It was an age ruled by both the poet and the executioner; poets scattered roses everywhere, while the executioner cast a long shadow of terror.&quot;  It was a force that, as &quot;Sun&quot; reminds us, molded a new generation into killers without any sense of the long and tortured history of a China that existed before Mao brutally eliminated all traces of it. One of the few subtle points of &quot;Sun&quot; is that even simple, lurid tragedy looks different to its admirers as people mature. The eloquence of the interview subjects  and the clips have a power that the written narration, which often sounds like an &quot;All Things Considered&quot; segment, often lacks. &quot;Chairman Mao said, 'You young people are like the Morning Sun; our hope is placed on you,' &quot; remembers Li Nanyang, who was a child of 1960's China. And, as &quot;Sun&quot; unfolds, she's shown to be one of the Cultural Revolution's victims. Her father, Li Rui, who rose through the ranks to become Mao's secretary, made the mistake of criticizing a failing policy during the Great Leap Forward, when farms were converted into small factories and the resultant shortages nearly crippled the nation. His reward was being publicly repudiated and sent away.

It's the aftermath. The actors playing the characters who have been rocked by catastrophe don't sink to theatrical histrionics; instead they're linked by the red-eyed, unblinking stare of zombies, and they shamble through their day-by-day activities as if saddled with death wishes they are too enervated to act upon. This is American Existentialism. The stars achieve something that doesn't sound as if it's possible: a virtuosity in the depiction of people wasting away minute by minute. Be prepared for it. You won't come out unaffected, because the depths of intimacy that the director plumbs here are so rarely touched by filmmakers that &quot;21 Grams&quot; is tantamount to the discovery of a new country. Prof. Paul Rivers (Sean Penn) is suffering from a damaged heart, which is about to give out on him, and the transplant he receives so consumes him with guilt that he's like a death-row prisoner with a horrible secret who's been pardoned. He still believes he deserves to die. Cristina (Naomi Watts), a reformed party girl, has returned to her fallen ways after taking up with Paul. She's lost her family in an auto accident. And Jack (Benicio Del Toro) is a shaggy, trembling mountain of anger he can barely contain.

At the peak of his influence as a nightclub impresario and disc jockey, Mr.  Bingenheimer, a quiet, wizened gnome of indeterminate age with a pageboy haircut, was  a gatekeeper to the rock royalty. The movie is crammed with vintage photos and film  clips of Mr. Bingenheimer escorting beautiful girls and celebrities into his so-called  English disco, the tiny Los Angeles club he established during the heyday of British  glam-rock. Hollywood is well stocked with oddballs like Mr. Bingenheimer who glean  their self-worth from access to celebrity. But fame, observed up close, is a cold and  voracious entity, and the &quot;Mayor of the Sunset Strip,&quot; almost without trying, makes you  feel its chilly pull. \u2014 Stephen Holden", "multimedia": null}, {"headline": "Can Love Flourish Across a Divide?", "publication_date": "2003-10-17", "byline": "Stephen Holden", "critics_pick": 1, "date_updated": "2016-03-30 06:55:39", "opening_date": null, "display_title": "Raja", "link": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B0DE2D6173EF934A25753C1A9659C8B63", "suggested_link_text": "Read the New York Times Review of Raja", "type": "article"}, "mpaa_rating": "", "summary_short": "Jacques Doillon's serious comedy plumbs murky depths of a ticklish question. When there's a glaring disparity in income, age and cultural sophistication between two potential partners, what are the reasonable chances that love can flourish untainted by opportunism and exploitation? The possible lovers who get caught up in diabolical mind games are 19-year-old Raja (Najat Benssallem), a fiery-tied,  tomboyish Moroccan girl who lives on the streets of Marrakech, and Fred (Pascal  Greggory), a wealthy, idle Frenchman of around 50 who lives like a prince.
