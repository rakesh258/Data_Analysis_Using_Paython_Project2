And in between musical sequences, Jim Jarmusch finds a visual form that mirrors the spirit of the music. All in all, great sounds and a loose, good-humored tribute to Neil Young's 30 years of maverick rock-and-roll. &#151; Janet Maslin", "multimedia": null}, {"headline": "Public Housing (Movie)  ", "publication_date": "1997-10-04", "byline": "Janet Maslin", "critics_pick": 0, "date_updated": "2016-03-30 07:12:00", "opening_date": null, "display_title": "Public Housing", "link": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E05EFDC153DF937A35753C1A961958260", "suggested_link_text": "Read the New York Times Review of Public Housing", "type": "article"}, "mpaa_rating": "", "summary_short": "", "multimedia": null}, {"headline": "Destiny (Movie)  ", "publication_date": "1997-10-04", "byline": "Stephen Holden", "critics_pick": 0, "date_updated": "2016-03-30 06:54:23", "opening_date": "1998-10-16", "display_title": "Destiny", "link": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9902E6DB153DF937A35753C1A961958260", "suggested_link_text": "Read the New York Times Review of Destiny", "type": "article"}, "mpaa_rating": "", "summary_short": "Islamic fundamentalists in 12th-century Spain.

Maggie Smith steals many a scene as the heroine's fluttery aunt. As Jane Campion's ''Portrait of a Lady'' illustrated, James's fiction lends itself to revealingly symbolic interpretation.
