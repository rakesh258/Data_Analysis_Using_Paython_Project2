The movie holds few surprises; you always know where it's going, and sometimes you can predict exactly what the characters are going to say. But Daldry finds honest feeling and dramatic integrity in shopworn material, and the cast, notably Gary Lewis as Billy's father, Julie Walters as his teacher, and young Jamie Bell as Billy himself, help rescue the movie from its most hackneyed impulses. \u2014 A.

This is no small feat, given the dizzying amount of exposition in these movies.  Outrageous plot pile-ons certainly take place in &quot;Tiger&quot;   \u2014   a practice as ritualistic as having a martial arts master and student square off against each other, also a part of the picture. Fans of the genre will giggle with delight over the canny way Lee handles the intersections, and audiences new to these films will shudder with excitement.
