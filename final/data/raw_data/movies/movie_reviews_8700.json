The film, however, makes one thing abundantly clear. American musical comedy as we know it wouldn't exist without the precedent of Yiddish theater, whose jolly, fun-for-fun's-sake communal spirit goes to the essence of Broadway. \u2014 Stephen Holden", "multimedia": null}, {"headline": "Astoria (Movie)", "publication_date": "2002-04-05", "byline": "Lawrence Van Gelder", "critics_pick": 0, "date_updated": "2016-03-30 07:16:17", "opening_date": "2006-03-28", "display_title": "Astoria", "link": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C07E6D9163DF936A35757C0A9649C8B63", "suggested_link_text": "Read the New York Times Review of Astoria", "type": "article"}, "mpaa_rating": "R", "summary_short": "As one character in &quot;Astoria&quot; says, there is a Greek-American law: you'll do fine as long as your parents run your life for you.

Alex has been to college, but geographically and emotionally he has seen little of the world beyond Astoria, Queens.

We see this in the first sequence, when the belligerently jealous Mario (Ren\u00e9 Wanko) threatens the guys who look at his girlfriend, Klaudia (Franziska Weiss); he seems to leave pools of testosterone wherever he steps. After he forces her unwanted suitors away and floors his car through the streets of Vienna, he screams at Klaudia and throws her out of the car. We then get the credit sequence, with several groups of people shown sunning themselves under the piercing sun; the pictures could be a melting mess bringing together Francis Bacon and David Hockney. With these shots of the pale cast of characters, we can almost feel the melanoma developing. Mr. Seidl treats the chemistry of human relationships like a cancer, an enormous growth that, unchecked, leads to disease. And he fixates on flesh, scouring it with his camera to search for a trace of the humanity within. He doesn't find much; the men and women in &quot;Dog Days&quot; are broken down into bullies and victims. Mr. Seidl, who wrote the screenplay with Veronika Franz, seems determined to make an answer to &quot;American Beauty.&quot; The picture is set in a tract-house suburb, with identical houses crammed next to one another, and the lack of space and the heat make an appropriate context for the wanton mistreatment. But there is genuine curiosity in Mr. Seidl's filmmaking; he treats his story as if he were shooting a documentary. The believability comes from the casting: Mr. Seidl has found a group of actors and nonprofessionals who interact spectacularly well. \u2014 Elvis Mitchell", "multimedia": null}, {"headline": "Inner Tour, The (Movie)", "publication_date": "2002-04-01", "byline": "Elvis Mitchell", "critics_pick": 0, "date_updated": "2016-03-30 06:48:57", "opening_date": null, "display_title": "The Inner Tour", "link": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9507E4DB143AF932A35757C0A9649C8B63", "suggested_link_text": "Read the New York Times Review of The Inner Tour", "type": "article"}, "mpaa_rating": "", "summary_short": "", "multimedia": null}, {"headline": "Fast Runner, the (Movie)", "publication_date": "2002-03-30", "byline": "A.

Zacharias Kunuk's adaptation of an ancient folk-tale, which won the Camera d'Or for best first feature at last year's Cannes International Film Festival, is much more than an ethnographic curiosity. It is, by any standard, an extraordinary film, a work of narrative sweep and visual beauty that honors the history of the art form even as it extends its perspective. The story about a vendetta that threatens the happiness of the hero and the stability of his nomadic, seal-hunting clan, takes a while to establish itself, but it has the clarity and the power common to epics from the sagas of ancient Scandinavia to the westerns of the old Hollywood. Austere and violent, the movie is also touched by humor and sensuality, and full of unforgettable images of the blinding Arctic landscape. Mr. Kunuk and his cast have accomplished the remarkable feat of endowing his archetypal characters from with complicated psychological motives and responses.
