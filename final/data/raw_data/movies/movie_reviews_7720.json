Written by Mr. Hampton and Penny Fearon, the script imagines an ageless Graham still alive in contemporary New York City, where she is desperately searching for the money to mount her latest modern ballet, an interpretation of the Phaedra myth.  As Martha tromps around the city, looking for financial and institutional support, she's followed by a camera crew led by documentary filmmaker Barbara Rosen (Ann Magnuson), whose voice over-narration fills in much of the necessary background. Ms. Magnuson's consummate professionalism offers an unflattering contrast to Mr. Move's not-so-inspired amateurism.  Where Ms. Magnuson's performance is based on careful modulations of her silky voice, Mr. Move spends most of the movie hissing through clenched teeth, in a falsetto that unfortunately but inescapably suggests Frank Oz's Miss Piggy. &#151; Dave Kehr", "multimedia": null}, {"headline": "F.B.I.

The story is a bit soft: Viktor is befriended by a motley group of airport workers, bedeviled by a Homeland Security apparatchik (Stanley Tucci) and beguiled by an unhappy flight attendant (Catherine Zeta-Jones). There is a bit too much easy sentiment and artificial sweetness, and Ms. Zeta-Jones's character is woefully underwritten. But these flaws cannot dispel the film's deep enchantment. Mr. Hanks, like Mr. Spielberg, has nothing left to prove, and the nuances lurking in his sly, genial performance emerge only in retrospect. Similarly, the movie's deepest engagement with some of the central anxieties of modern life can be found not in its plot but in its ambience.

Hoping to perform some preventive maintenance on their marriage, the Pressmans decide to put on an Equity-waiver production of Terence McNally's 1987 play &quot;Frankie and Johnnie in the Clair de Lune.&quot; Mr. Pressman will quit his day job &#151; as a show-runner for David E. Kelley, the television producer, who also plays himself &#151; and direct; Ms. Chess will star. Alan Rosenberg is very funny and very pointed as the Method-crazed actor who nearly destroys the production; for the rest, the picture is very much in the softly didactic, sentimental mode of Mr. Pressman's television. &#151; Dave Kehr", "multimedia": null}, {"headline": "Scrabble Addicts, Seeking Meaning in a Mishmash of Letters", "publication_date": "2004-06-11", "byline": "Ned Martel", "critics_pick": 0, "date_updated": "2016-03-30 06:58:39", "opening_date": null, "display_title": "Word Wars", "link": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D0CE0D81430F932A25755C0A9629C8B63", "suggested_link_text": "Read the New York Times Review of Word Wars", "type": "article"}, "mpaa_rating": "Not Rated", "summary_short": "The Scrabble champions in this documentary find obscure game-changers in a rack of seven letters, but they can't find their way out of their common obsession. In this film's obvious inspiration, &quot;Spellbound,&quot; the audience could always hope that the rote learning of spelling bee contestants was honing keener minds for happier days. &quot;Word Wars&quot; is instead taxing, requiring patience for grainy photography, garage-band power chords and griping childlike contestants. These men can work orthographic wonders, but it never lifts them out of their self-imposed exiles. Without much else racking up points in their isolated lives, the Scrabble players' monomania amounts to little, and these contestants seem like words that lose their beauty when they're never put in a sentence. &#151; Ned Martel", "multimedia": null}], "num_results": 20, "status": "OK", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2017 The New York Times Company.
