The two share a special bond, having lost their parents in a car  crash when they were children. Matthew Broderick is Sammy's stuffy new boss at the  bank where she works as a loan officer. The tensions that erupt may not be the most  melodramatic domestic problems ever filmed, but they're the stuff of life, and Linney's and Ruffalo's performances are achingly perfect. \u2014 Stephen Holden", "multimedia": null}, {"headline": "Angel's Ladies (Movie)  ", "publication_date": "2000-11-10", "byline": "Lawrence Van Gelder", "critics_pick": 0, "date_updated": "2016-03-30 07:14:06", "opening_date": null, "display_title": "Angel's Ladies", "link": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9A0DE4D91738F933A25752C1A9669C8B63", "suggested_link_text": "Read the New York Times Review of Angel's Ladies", "type": "article"}, "mpaa_rating": "", "summary_short": "", "multimedia": null}, {"headline": "Rebels With a Cause (Movie)  ", "publication_date": "2000-11-10", "byline": "A.

Unfortunately, this loud, trashy updating of the 70's television show isn't as much fun as it should be, despite Ms. Diaz's spirited comic performance. The Hong Kong-style action sequences are lamely edited and staged, and the film swings wildly between tiresome intentional self-parody and the unintentional kind, which is even more annoying. &#151; A.
