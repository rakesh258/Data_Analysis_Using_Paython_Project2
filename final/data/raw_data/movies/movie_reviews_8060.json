While far from his best work, this slight, tart anti-romantic comedy has a loose, easy rhythm and an impressive number of funny lines and gags. Jason Biggs, who is perhaps a little too amiable for the job, plays the Woody Allen surrogate, a comedy writer named Jerry Falk who is saddled with a difficult manager (Danny  DeVito) and an impossible girlfriend, a would-be actress named Amanda (Christina Ricci). Amanda, a sexual dynamo and a manipulative head case, might have been an exercise in sour misogyny, but Ms. Ricci has a feral intelligence that turns her into a finely drawn comic monster. Mr. Allen himself appears as an older comedy writer who appoints himself Jerry's mentor. The character \u2014 paranoid, vengeful, bluntly anti-intellectual \u2014 is both the continuation of other Woody Allen characters and a rebuke to their needy, self-conscious, analytical approaches to life. \u2014 A.O.
