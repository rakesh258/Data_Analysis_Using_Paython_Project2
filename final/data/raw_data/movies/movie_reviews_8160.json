Mr. Eason's ear for speech is as impressive as his eye for local detail, and the film manages to be at once intimate and tactful. Frankie G., who plays Manny's protective older brother, Junior, has some rough edges, but he shows himself to be a powerful actor with the ability to display the nuances of his character's contradictory temperament.

And though the ever-deepening story takes its name from Edith Hahn-Beer's autobiographical 1999 book, &quot;The Nazi Officer's Wife: How One Jewish Woman Survived the Holocaust,'' questions of identity - and the continual submersion of self to stay alive - are the heart of the story. &quot;Edith Hahn willed herself to disappear,'' says the narrator, Susan Sarandon. It is a bewitching and harrowing tale, told by the woman who survived the impostures in which she cloaked herself. The narrative has the engrossing folds and twists of a novel. Hahn-Beer loses her true love to cowardice, her mother to the Nazis. Years later, she gains a family of her own, after assuming the identity of an Aryan she knew years earlier. She burrows so completely into this falsehood that she marries a kind German, who's also a Nazi sympathizer. (By the end of the war, he's drafted and she takes on the absurd and frightening position of the title of her book.) And she so deeply sublimates her feisty, fiery personality in playing the role of a compliant wife that she comes to love her second existence. Finally, what threatens to become a life sentence of self-abnegation is commuted because the man who loved Hahn-Beer and abandoned her earlier persuaded the young woman into hiding her real identity papers in the lining of a book. Despite the dramatic sweep of her life, the actual threat of extermination for Hahn-Beer, a law student in her late 20's who endured in Nazi Germany by secreting away much of herself, gives the movie a grave, transfixing air of real-life existentialism. \u2014 Elvis Mitchell", "multimedia": null}, {"headline": "Cross-breeding Animated Franchises", "publication_date": "2003-06-13", "byline": "Dave Kehr", "critics_pick": 0, "date_updated": "2016-03-30 07:27:29", "opening_date": "2003-06-13", "display_title": "Rugrats Go Wild", "link": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C06E4D81F39F930A25755C0A9659C8B63", "suggested_link_text": "Read the New York Times Review of Rugrats Go Wild", "type": "article"}, "mpaa_rating": "PG", "summary_short": "&quot;Rugrats Quietly Go About Their Business as Usual&quot; would be a more accurate if less elegant title for this minimally animated film based on the enduring cable cartoon program, which finds the resourceful children and their helpless parents stranded on a deserted tropical island, after the charter boat hired by hapless Stu Pickles (voiced by Jack Riley) goes down.
