The film centers on a desperate, childless couple, Karel (Jan Hartl) and his anxious wife, Bozena (Veronika Zilkova). When Karel finds a tree stump that reminds him of a baby and brings it to Bozena, she hungrily lavishes it with maternal care and demands they treat it as a real child. Because this Czech master refuses to work in the scrubbed, antiseptic manner of most animators, this fable comes to life as hilarious and creepy. Finally, though, because of its obvious, reductive condescension, the picture is a half-hour too long. \u2013 Elvis Mitchell", "multimedia": null}, {"headline": "Lantana (Movie) ", "publication_date": "2001-12-14", "byline": "A.
