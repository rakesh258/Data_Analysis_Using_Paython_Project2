But the story is thin, and the characters, in spite of some good performances by the younger cast members, are too close to stereotypes for this to be much more than a tidy parable of the obvious. \u2014 A.

It is a place, declares his character, Thomas Fowler, where colors and tastes seem sharper than they do elsewhere and where even the rain has a special intensity. Fowler is a wistfully cynical British journalist who has fled an arid marriage in England to live in Southeast Asia, where he is reporting on the Vietnamese fight for independence from French colonial rule. Fowler may be the richest character of Mr. Caine's screen career.
