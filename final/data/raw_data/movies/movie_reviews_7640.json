Mr. Gallo plays Bud Clay, a motorcycle racer (and the title's symbolic bunny) on his way back home to Los Angeles from a New Hampshire meet. As Bud racks up miles, he stares moodily at the road, visits a childhood haunt, eats a lonely meal, sleeps a lonely motel sleep, takes his motorcycle for a spin and exchanges small talk with a few women, all of whom have the soft, bruised look of chronic disappointment. Eventually, Bud hits Los Angeles, where he checks into a hotel, and where yet another flower of femininity, Chloe Sevigny's Daisy, gives the film its back-story and furnishes what the porn industry calls, in rather more direct language, its economic raison d'etre. \u2014 Manohla Dargis", "multimedia": null}, {"headline": "A Serial Killer Who Stalks Other Serial Killers Is Loose", "publication_date": "2004-08-27", "byline": "Manohla Dargis", "critics_pick": 0, "date_updated": "2016-03-30 07:20:15", "opening_date": "2004-08-27", "display_title": "Suspect Zero", "link": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C01E3DD103EF934A1575BC0A9629C8B63", "suggested_link_text": "Read the New York Times Review of Suspect Zero", "type": "article"}, "mpaa_rating": "R", "summary_short": "Finally, a serial killer movie so preposterous, so garnished with accidental laugh lines and absent essential narrative logic it may actually put a permanent kibosh on this tediously overworked crime subgenre.

Think &quot;Seven&quot; minus the talent. Soon after the agent Thomas Mackelway (Aaron Eckhart) lands in the F.B.I.'s Albuquerque bureau, he discovers a man's mutilated body carefully arranged amid the cacti and sand. One thing leads to another leads to a halfway house where twitchy Benjamin O'Ryan (Ben Kingsley) scratches out the kind of eerily beautiful artwork so beloved of movie sociopaths.

Stephen Campbell Moore and Emily Mortimer are touching and funny as the central couple, an impecunious aristocrat named Adam Symes and his long-term fianc\u00e9e, Nina, but the picture is brought to life by its large supporting cast of both well-known and unknown British actors (and one Canadian, Dan Ackroyd, playing a blustering press baron).
