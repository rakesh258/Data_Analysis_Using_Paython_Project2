It's a typically nervy performance that pumps adrenaline into what is essentially a talky  moral debate. Defending his decision not to leave Germany, the courtly conductor  vigorously insists that art is a higher calling and should be divorced from politics.  Although the screenplay, adapted by Ronald Harwood from his own play, is schematic  and talky and the issues it debates familiar, its arguments are still worth contemplating.

Mr. Kowalski's new film, &quot;Hey Is Dee Dee Home,&quot; is a rueful, reflective companion piece to &quot;Born to Lose.&quot; Its subject is one of Mr. Thunders's collaborators and fellow addicts, Dee Dee Ramone, who died of a drug overdose in June 2002.   With songs like  &quot;I Wanna Be Sedated&quot; and &quot;Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue&quot; to his credit (he often wrote under his real name, Douglas Colvin), Mr. Ramone made no secret of his drug use, and he remains a leading example of that brand of self-destructive romantic revolt pioneered in the 19th century by the French poets Charles Baudelaire and Arthur Rimbaud. As extreme as  his behavior and music often were, Mr. Ramone also seemed to be a sympathetic and reasonably self-aware person, at least as he is captured here in a sobered-up, 1991 interview that Mr. Kowalski unearthed and placed at the center of this film. &#151; Dave Kehr", "multimedia": null}, {"headline": "Disaffected Teenagers and Looming Calamity", "publication_date": "2003-09-03", "byline": "Elvis Mitchell", "critics_pick": 0, "date_updated": "2016-03-30 07:09:12", "opening_date": null, "display_title": "Zero Day", "link": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9A07E1DC1238F930A3575AC0A9659C8B63", "suggested_link_text": "Read the New York Times Review of Zero Day", "type": "article"}, "mpaa_rating": "Not Rated", "summary_short": "In &quot;Zero Day,&quot; the teenaged high schooler Cal (Calvin Robertson) has a sarcastic mantra that he often utters: &quot;These are the best years of our lives.&quot; But the first time he says it in director Ben Coccio's drama sets the tone.

When Mao and Lenin invade the store, sizing her up as they drop ridicule, &quot;Suddenly&quot; takes a quick jump. The movie isn't judgmental about size or appearance; it's more interested in slapping down the bourgeoisie. It's a relief, because their prey, with her rounded, pleasant features and slightly awkward gait, doesn't deserve to be humiliated. The Argentine director is at his best in displaying his talents when there is little or no dialogue, especially as the sexual axis shifts between the three girls. The stoic volatility of the opening 10 minutes drifts into another movie altogether, one where a tenderness develops between the threesome as they get to know one another.

This dazzling and dazed movie begins on the streets of New York, as a camera moseys down a street and then crawls up the side of a building, peering into several windows as various apartment dwellers play out their lives. It settles on a darkened room that Edge (Mr. Lester) has just broken into. He's prowling the apparently empty place for valuables, casting around and finding nothing but old photographs, some of which seem to date back to the beginning of the 20th century. He's surprised in his dirty work by the place's elderly inhabitant, Angela (Rosemary Murphy). He hits her, and before he can escape, she whips out a large antique \u2014 but still functional \u2014 six-shooter and proceeds to tell prattle on about her life. Her tale, unfolding in black and white and set in the Old West, finally ends up in Macedonia. It is the story of two brothers, the lusty outlaw Luke (Mr. Wenham) and his virtuous, religious brother Elijah (Mr. Fiennes). Mr. Manchevski suavely shuffles his various narrative, sometimes smoothly presenting the juxtaposed tales, and on other occasions, cutting violently from one of the stories to another. The literal violence \u2014 gun battles and punches detonating all of over both stories and leaving a spray of intentional confusion \u2014 happens to be staged with bracing clarity. The director signals that he's as unreliable a narrator as Angela, because what's more important than relaying facts in &quot;Dust&quot; is communicating emotion. It's a splintered-storytelling approach that Mr. Manchevski employed to insinuate the plot of his ingeniously realized &quot;Before the Rain,&quot; where the slivers of apparently haphazardly scattered plot points all came together. &quot;Dust&quot; lacks that film's central psychological underpinnings. Eventually, &quot;Dust&quot; is overly convenient and such an under-explained mystery that it never makes any sense. \u2014 Elvis Mitchell", "multimedia": null}, {"headline": "Trading Barbie for Drugs, Sex and Halter Tops", "publication_date": "2003-08-20", "byline": "Elvis Mitchell", "critics_pick": 1, "date_updated": "2016-03-30 06:51:11", "opening_date": "2003-09-19", "display_title": "Thirteen", "link": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D03E6DB1130F933A1575BC0A9659C8B63", "suggested_link_text": "Read the New York Times Review of Thirteen", "type": "article"}, "mpaa_rating": "R", "summary_short": "The panic in the eyes of Tracy (Evan Rachel Wood), the barely teenaged protagonist of &quot;Thirteen,&quot; will stay with you for a very long time. &quot;Thirteen&quot; treats Tracy's behavior as a fever dream, something viral. This disease eating up her empathy and decency is what she picked up from the effortlessly cool Evie (Nikki Reed), who crashes into Tracy's life and plucks her from an existence of age-appropriate fixations like Barbie dolls. Evie, with the physical confidence of a much older girl, knows exactly how to devastate Tracy; she breezily drops hints that she thinks her new friend is immature. As Evie takes Tracy under her broken wing to remake her, we feel we're watching the protagonist of &quot;Thirteen&quot; undergo the initiations of a new tribe.  The closest  the film comes to a narrative is in following its young central figure straying into sex, drugs and alienation and her sudden detachment from her struggling single mother, Melanie (Holly  Hunter). What we recognize from the stricken look in Melanie's face is the same panic in Tracy's eyes \u2014 it's something mother and daughter share, and Ms. Hunter wills this spiritual match-up into existence. The movie has the ebb and flow that comes from material structured as a series of anecdotes \u2014  it doesn't build, and sometimes it feels as cluttered as a 13-year-old's bedroom. But that may be a byproduct of Catherine Hardwicke's attempt to layer incidents that are as far as possible from the weary set of clich\u00e9s that inform pictures about teens. Ms. Hardwicke, making her directorial debut, works from a screenplay she authored with Ms. Reed, shaped around autobiographical elements from the actress's own life. Usually, the protagonist is the bystander \u2014 in &quot;Thirteen,&quot; she's the fuse. \u2014 Elvis Mitchell", "multimedia": null}, {"headline": "Hopping Freight Trains in the Twilight of Hobo Tradition", "publication_date": "2003-08-20", "byline": "Stephen Holden", "critics_pick": 0, "date_updated": "2016-03-30 06:50:29", "opening_date": null, "display_title": "Catching Out", "link": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C03E3DD1130F933A1575BC0A9659C8B63", "suggested_link_text": "Read the New York Times Review of Catching Out", "type": "article"}, "mpaa_rating": "Not Rated", "summary_short": "This picturesque documentary is an exhilarating group portrait of four self-styled tramps and hobos who follow their bliss by illegally hopping freight trains that traverse some of the country's most beautiful terrain. One goal most have in common is to live as far outside the system as possible and not have to pay rent or work for a boss. Lee is a survivalist and anarchist  who lives in the woods and publishes a rail-riding zine. Switch and Baby Girl are a hippie  couple who must give up the lifestyle when they have a baby. Jessica is a restless college  dropout. Achieving such independence, of course, requires a high degree of self-sufficiency and tolerance for physical discomfort. The movie jumps track near the end  when it makes a cursory attempt to put the lifestyle into a broader historical context. &#151; Stephen Holden", "multimedia": null}], "num_results": 20, "status": "OK", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2017 The New York Times Company.
