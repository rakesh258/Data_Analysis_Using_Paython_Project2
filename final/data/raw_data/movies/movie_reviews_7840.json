Even as you laugh, it's a movie you admire more than love. Mr. Gondry, displaying an impressively quicksilver, scrambling technique, is working with a much better script than he had for &quot;Human Nature,&quot; his previous collaboration with the screenwriter Charlie Kaufman (&quot;Being John Malkovich,&quot; &quot;Adaptation&quot;).  Kate Winslet is Clem, the brash, loquacious bookstore employee who meets Joel (Jim Carrey) as he wanders the streets alone on Valentine's Day. The two of them fall in love under a glum, flannel cloud cover that could use some eternal sunshine.  After they break up, Joel's ego is bruised when he finds out that Clem has had all memories of him erased from her mind. Devastated, he goes for the same treatment. Mr. Kaufman has conjured the film equivalent of a Philip K. Dick Hallmark card. The movie has all of the knickknacks of a Kaufman script, including a nerdy, socially inept protagonist. In the case of &quot;Mind,&quot; this translates into Joel's being the least developed character. Mr. Carrey does get to show some aplomb in the final scene, when Joel acts out the most mature sentiment ever found in a Kaufman script, that having one's psyche purged isn't necessarily a good thing. What becomes of the broken-hearted, after the conversation has dimmed, is that they get over it. And by concluding with an adult realization, the film lets sunlight peek through the gloom, in more ways than one. \u2014 Elvis Mitchell", "multimedia": null}, {"headline": "It's France, 1940, and Farce Is in the Air", "publication_date": "2004-03-19", "byline": "Stephen Holden", "critics_pick": 1, "date_updated": "2016-03-30 06:56:53", "opening_date": "2004-05-21", "display_title": "Bon Voyage", "link": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C00E1D61231F93AA25750C0A9629C8B63", "suggested_link_text": "Read the New York Times Review of Bon Voyage", "type": "article"}, "mpaa_rating": "PG-13", "summary_short": "If an award were given to a movie for skillful crowd control,  this rich, teeming French farce set in and around Bordeaux in 1940 on the  eve of the German occupation of Paris would be a leading contender.

The players arrive in a gloomy town where a woman is about to be unjustly executed for the murder of a boy. Scrapping their traditional material, they decide to perform a piece based on the case. &quot;This is how plays will be made in times to come,&quot; Mr. Dafoe intones. Also many television programs. This painfully earnest adaptation of Barry Unsworth's novel would probably have worked better as a cheesy series about a priest turned actor turned fearless crime-fighter. \u2014 A. O.

Both films are meditations on the scale of a catastrophe so enormous that all the assembled rescue resources seem paltry and inadequate. Many grief-stricken, traumatized words are uttered in &quot;Collateral Damages,&quot; a personal scrapbook of the memories of several firefighters who survived the horrors.  Despite its anguish, the movie suggests that time does heal, and that even the worst memories eventually sink in and are absorbed. \u2014 Stephen Holden", "multimedia": null}], "num_results": 20, "status": "OK", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2017 The New York Times Company.
