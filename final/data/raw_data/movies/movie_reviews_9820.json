Loosely knit, sometimes uproarious, the film benefits enormously from Alec Baldwin's deft performance as the boy's small-minded, memorably impossible father. &#151; Janet Maslin", "multimedia": null}, {"headline": "Chill Factor (Movie)  ", "publication_date": "1999-09-01", "byline": "Stephen Holden", "critics_pick": 0, "date_updated": "2016-03-30 06:57:12", "opening_date": "1999-09-01", "display_title": "Chill Factor", "link": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=980DEFD61E3BF932A3575AC0A96F958260", "suggested_link_text": "Read the New York Times Review of Chill Factor", "type": "article"}, "mpaa_rating": "R", "summary_short": "A deadly defoliant named Elvis.

This muse is quite a piece of work, but she seems to get results, on the evidence of a couple of inspired cameos here. The joke of a premise winds down before it reaches a punch line.
