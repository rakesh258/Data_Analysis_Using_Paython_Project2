Some of the sequences &#151;  especially those contrasting her moribund life at home with Hao-hao versus getting her pupils dilated at the clubs &#151;  have a startling staying power.  Mr. Hou has a gift for vibrant shocks that roam around in an audience's head for years. When that singularly perverse capacity of his isn't connected to something more substantial, it seems a waste. Despite its artistry, &quot;Mambo&quot; seems to last nearly a millennium. &#151;  Elvis Mitchell", "multimedia": null}, {"headline": "Even in Fabled Neverland, a World of Contradictions", "publication_date": "2003-12-25", "byline": "A.

J. Hogan's adaptation of J. M. Barrie's novel is bracingly true to the tough, buoyant spirit of the original, and his filmmaking style is a perfect mixture of wide-eyed wonder and slightly melancholy sophistication. While Peter (Jeremy Sumpter) is appropriately dashing and adventurous, Hook (Jason Isaacs) wonderfully villainous and Tinker Bell (Ludivine Sagnier) as cute and naughty as anyone could wish, the movie belongs to Rachel Hurd-Wood's Wendy Darling. Ms. Hurd-Wood, a 13-year-old British actress making her professional debut, was born for the role, which calls on her to be a precocious child, an action heroine, the surrogate mother of a tribe of Lost Boys, and the romantic lead. Her soft, sensitive features display both Wendy's child-like eagerness and her incipient wisdom without overdoing either trait, and she and Mr. Sumpter remind us that Peter Pan, beyond all the swashbuckling and fantasy, is a love story, which ends on a poignant Jamesian note of renunciation. The sets and special effects are rousing and vivid, but what distinguishes this Peter Pan from the other versions (and from most recent children s entertainment) is its unsentimental insight into the terrors and delights of both childhood and growing up. \u2014 A.

The story of a big, mostly happy family that includes 12 mostly adorable children and two mostly adoring parents whose 23-year marriage still has a snap of sex is set in suburban Illinois.  But its real location is that imaginary playground of cheery roughhouse and sanitized mischief known as Sitcomland, where it is now and forever 1955.  For Steve Martin, who has earned his crown as the movies' most affably, reassuring 50's-style dad since Spencer  Tracy, the role of the paterfamilias who coaches college football is just not a piece of  cake but a morsel of buttery fudge that instantly melts on his tongue. \u2014 Stephen Holden", "multimedia": null}], "num_results": 20, "status": "OK", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2017 The New York Times Company.
