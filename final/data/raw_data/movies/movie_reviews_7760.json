His update imagines Oliver as a blond, virginal teenager (Joshua Close) who has run away from a grim life in the provinces to the big city, where on his first night in town he is lucky enough to run into Dodge (Nick Stahl), a youthful prostitute who takes him back to the dormitory for lost boys operated by Fagin (Gary Farmer, the roly-poly Indian actor of Jim Jarmusch's &quot;Dead Man&quot;). The act of placing a larger-than-life literary figures in a constrained, narrowly naturalistic environment merely strips the characters of their scale and interest.

The &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; writer and performer Tina Fey wrote the script and gives the material a stylized vitality. But it does add a be-yourself finale that, while standard for such movies, this picture doesn't quite seem to buy \u2014 it's the kind of bored manipulation you come to expect from the Plastics, the pack of hallway-shrewd and glamorous teen queens who rule, through subtle terror, the high school that Cady (Ms. Lohan) attends. It's her first brush with socialization, since Cady was home schooled by her zoologist parents, who raised their daughter while traveling in Africa. Since most of &quot;Girls&quot; consists of the outsider Cady observing the tribal rites of her new setting and laying it all out in narration, this movie is great home for the meticulous and ruthless deadpan that Ms. Fey has perfected for the satirical &quot;S.N.L.&quot; newscast. Though narrative cohesion isn't the strength of &quot;Girls&quot; \u2014 as a series of moments, it works better from scene to scene than as a whole \u2014 the intelligence shines in its understanding of contradictions. Scene by scene, you can't help but be impressed by &quot;Girls&quot;; it's like a group of sketches linked by theme, with some playing much better than others. But after a while, it does begin to seem like it has the easily diverted attention span of one of its archetypal high school kids \u2014 you feel a little like a scold for wanting it to buckle down and concentrate. \u2014 Elvis Mitchell", "multimedia": null}], "num_results": 20, "status": "OK", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2017 The New York Times Company.
