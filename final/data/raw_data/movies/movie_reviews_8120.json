It begins with Luc\u00eda narrating; she is about to board a plane with her husband, Ram\u00f3n, for a Brazilian vacation. He disappears with the tickets as the flight is being announced. After the initial shock of her husband's broad-daylight vanishing wears off, she's forced to recognize that her marriage hadn't been a particularly happy one for some time. Ms. Roth's radiance and understanding of Luc\u00eda's emotional life gives this movie a touch of necessary psychological accessibility. Movies of this subgenre, in which the protagonist has to come to an understanding of herself by measuring her own life against her previous somnolent bourgeoisie existence, can feel vapid. This is partially because the star has to awaken from her own passivity before our very eyes. Ms. Roth makes Luc\u00eda's state a willful ignorance instead, and her emerging recognition of her unhappiness, as new information comes to light, adds a dimension to the material. The film also has two able, love-struck neighbors who lend her a couple of hands: F\u00e9lix (Carlos Alvarez Novoa) &#151; a battered and elderly former political firebrand who still has a bit of a fuse left &#151; and Adri\u00e1n (Kuno Becker), a 20-ish musician determined to prove his seriousness by quoting dense philosophical precepts at the most inopportune moments.

But the modesty of this miniature  but tasty French souffl\u00e9, adapted from a novel by Christian Oster, suits its purposes. Jean-Pierre Bacri is a 50-something sound engineer warily fending for himself after the breakup of a marriage, and Emilie Dequennne the 20-year-old housekeeper Laura, who invades his life and  lures him into an affair that takes them to the coast of Brittany for a strained vacation.  The movie's biggest weakness is the underwritten character of Laura, who is less a full-blown  character than an opaque symbol of youth and its careless ways. \u2014 Stephen Holden", "multimedia": null}, {"headline": "A Student Seeks the Spark to Rekindle His Faith", "publication_date": "2003-07-11", "byline": "Stephen Holden", "critics_pick": 0, "date_updated": "2016-03-30 06:53:21", "opening_date": null, "display_title": "The Holy Land", "link": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9F0DEFDD113DF932A25754C0A9659C8B63", "suggested_link_text": "Read the New York Times Review of The Holy Land", "type": "article"}, "mpaa_rating": "Not Rated", "summary_short": "In following the odyssey of a shy ultra-Orthodox Jewish scholar who suspends his rabbinical studies to flail around in Israel's secular  fleshpots and trail around after a 19-year-old Russian prostitute, this ambitious  but muddled film is a contemporary variation on the parable of the  prodigal son. The movie is also a barbed reflection on the great divide between secular  and ultra-orthodox Judaism in Israeli culture. If the performances are strong, the  digressive screenplay lacks focus and momentum and is too oblique to connect many of  the dots between its characters and their behavior.
