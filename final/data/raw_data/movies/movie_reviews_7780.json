The movie, which subscribes to the hero-as-masochist archetype, is as reverent in its awed, Sunday-school way as &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; is in its furious, gory way. Mr. Caviezel's bland impenetrability may fit the screenplay's portrayal of Jones as a ferocious competitor who internalized stress and suffered physically for it, but his muted presence fails to create a compelling character. The movie, which wants to ennoble golf with the same spiritual mystique that &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot; brought to running, is even more hushed in tone than its prototype. But no amount of cinematic gloss (and symphonic musical uplift by James Horner) can cover up the fact that golf isn't an especially cinematic sport. &#151; Stephen Holden", "multimedia": null}, {"headline": "A Fool for Love Falls in Too Deep", "publication_date": "2004-04-30", "byline": "Stephen Holden", "critics_pick": 0, "date_updated": "2016-03-30 07:27:55", "opening_date": null, "display_title": "Bulgarian Lovers", "link": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9F01EFDD143DF933A05757C0A9629C8B63", "suggested_link_text": "Read the New York Times Review of Bulgarian Lovers", "type": "article"}, "mpaa_rating": "R", "summary_short": "This cynical dried-eyed comedy suggests a European echo of American cult movies like &quot;Scenes From the Class Struggle in Beverly Hills,&quot; in which sex is inextricably bound up with greed and social ambition.

This spiritual decency, a handful of songs from the toddler days of MTV and a few other fillips of clear-eyed charm go a long way toward making up for the tiredness of the concept, a kid magically leapfrogging into the body of an adult. In this case, it's 13-year-old Jenna (Christa B. Allen), who's suffering through a miserable failure of a birthday.  When some magic dust that a friend gives her lands on her carefully moussed hair, she awakens from a nap as a 30-year-old version of herself (Jennifer Garner). As acted by Ms. Garner, Jenna has a coltish gawkiness that she never quite sublimates. The obvious laughs are wrung from the contrast of an inexperienced child in a mature body, as Jenna bobs through a world in which the supposed adults turn out to be more childish than she is.

For most of its running time, actually, the director David C. Thomas manages to keep the film charging ahead of the wastrel clich\u00e9s that dot VH1's video tribute to rock 'n' roll wreckage because we're not just using one eye to catch a cobbled-together archive about Milli Vanilli or some band that beat the odds to one-hit wonderland. Rather, the proto-punk warriors known as the MC5 left a dent that outlasts their mostly negligible records sales, and the director's curiosity is piqued by the group's sociological impact. The band's members &#151; Wayne Kramer, Fred &quot;Sonic&quot; Smith, Rob Tyner, Michael Davis and Dennis Thompson &#151;  were caught up in the desires that ensnare most musicians: drugs and love of the audience. But for most of them, delivering body blows to the dozing status quo was as much a part of the motivation as any other. Such an ideal seems particularly quaint and, despite the fury from Smith and Tyner, attractively ingenuous. As depicted in &quot;Testimonial,&quot; the robust clash of ideology and ego &#151;  or the heart and the loins &#151;  is a great story, a shower of sparks. More important, given the crass commercial thrust of music these days, a band pursuing anything other than Soundscan numbers is such an unusual tale, it's surprising a dramatic version of the MC5 lifespan, which flamed out in 1972, has yet to be announced. With the aptly titled &quot;MC5: A True Testimonial,&quot; Mr. Thomas captures the taste for revolt in Detroit that inspired the MC5, a desperation that fueled more important pop figures (besides just Motown artists) than maybe in any other city &#151;  an outlaw eruption that ranged from Parliament/Funkadelic to Iggy Pop.

But its contradictions are subsumed under a high concept: &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot; meets &quot;Victor/Victoria&quot; in the land of &quot;As You Like It,&quot; with Shakespeare's Forest of Arden turned into a West  Hollywood drag club. Here Connie (Nia  Vardalos) and Carla (Toni Collette), two  bedraggled female veterans of the dinner-theater circuit on the run from mobsters, become  overnight (and highly unlikely) cult stars by posing as gay drag performers singing  Broadway standards. The movie knows and doesn't care that it has only the most tenuous connection to the real world. As drag performers, Ms. Collette (who at times resembles John Epperson as Lypsinka) is far more adroit at caricature than Ms. Vardalos, whose alter-ego suggests a homier, drag version of Kathy Najimy with a smirk that evokes traces of Mary Martin and Phyllis Diller. Some fun is to be had. \u2014 Stephen Holden", "multimedia": null}, {"headline": "Only This Hero's Rage Is Superhuman", "publication_date": "2004-04-16", "byline": "A. O.

The Punisher (Tom Jane) starts out as Frank Castle, a retired F.B.I. agent who falls afoul of a villainous mogul (John Travolta). After the bad guy's minions kill off Castle's entire extended family (with special attention to his wife and young son), Castle transforms himself into a ruthless, low-tech superhero, armed with guns, knives, military training and a portable fire hydrant. In attempting to answer the sadism of his enemies, he exceeds it, and Jonathan Hensleigh, a screenwriter making his directing debut, stages the mayhem with grim and ugly relish. \u2014 A. O.

Gypsy is abetted in her fantasies by Clive (Kett Turton), a gay teenager who shares her taste in fashion and music &#151;  they are both worshippers of Stevie Nicks &#151;  and designs Gypsy's makeup and costumes.  When the pair learns of a Stevie Nicks impersonator competition to be held at a New York nightclub, they hop into Gypsy's black TransAm and hit the road &#151;  wearing full Goth regalia, which causes them some predictable problems with the assorted truckers, frat boys and small town folks they meet on the way. Mr. Stephens, who also directed the independent film &quot;Edge of Seventeen,&quot; has filled &quot;Gypsy 83&quot; with rough language, strong sex talk and a couple of fairly explicit sexual encounters, but its edginess is as easily washed away as Clive's black lipstick.  This is a tiny, vulnerable, rather treacly film at heart, one that would probably float away were it not for Ms. Rue's generous presence. &#151; Dave Kehr", "multimedia": null}], "num_results": 20, "status": "OK", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2017 The New York Times Company.
