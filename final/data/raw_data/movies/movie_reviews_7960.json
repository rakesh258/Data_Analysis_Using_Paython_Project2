What that really means is a jolly but amorphous sequence of  related skits stretched into a feature film. Matt Walsh is Martin Flam, a suicidally inclined  advertising costume designer who places himself in the care of Dr. Orloff (Ian Roberts),  a supremely rude, self-regarding psychiatrist, and they gallivant around New York having zany adventures. The satire of therapy and the advertising business has its amusing moments, but the film lacks a center and the story barely coheres. &#151; Stephen Holden", "multimedia": null}, {"headline": "A Morbid Song Casts a Terrible Curse", "publication_date": "2003-11-07", "byline": "Stephen Holden", "critics_pick": 0, "date_updated": "2016-03-30 07:13:28", "opening_date": null, "display_title": "Gloomy Sunday", "link": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9904E4D91539F934A35752C1A9659C8B63", "suggested_link_text": "Read the New York Times Review of Gloomy Sunday", "type": "article"}, "mpaa_rating": "", "summary_short": "This contorted period melodrama, adapted from a book by Nick Barlow, constructs a creaky Holocaust drama around the  legend of &quot;Gloomy Sunday,&quot; a morbid Hungarian art song that is alleged to have driven hundreds to suicide in the 1930's. The story is set in a Budapest restaurant whose owner shares the woman he loves with the house pianist and composer of &quot;Gloomy Sunday.&quot; A customer and future Nazi SS officer also falls in love with her but is spurned. When he returns years later, he is in charge of the Final Solution in Hungary. If &quot;Gloomy Sunday&quot; were better written and acted, it might have transcended its own pretensions and cast a clammy spell. But the legend of the Song That Kills is just too hokey not to seem silly. &#151; Stephen Holden", "multimedia": null}], "num_results": 20, "status": "OK", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2017 The New York Times Company.
