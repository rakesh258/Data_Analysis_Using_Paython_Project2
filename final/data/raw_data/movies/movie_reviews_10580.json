Mr. Kline plays a small-town high school teacher shocked by the suggestion, made to a billion viewers of the Academy Awards show, that he is gay. Among those sent into shock by this thought are Joan Cusack as his alarmed fiancee, Debbie Reynolds in another wicked Mom role, and Wilford Brimley as the father who earnestly asks his son, ''Will you be goin' into show business?''
