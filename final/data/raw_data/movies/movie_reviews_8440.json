Lively, colorful and music-filled, it is both a travelogue and an introduction to Afro-Cuban music and religion. Salvador Gonz\u00e1lez, a curly-haired, bearded, cigar-smoking muralist and sculptor, is seen at work and at leisure in Havana, New York and Philadelphia. He has been strongly influenced, as a man and as an artist, by his African heritage and the Yoruban gods, goddesses and saints of Santer\u00eda, which fuses Afro-Cuban and Roman Catholic elements of religion. These influences, along with Picasso, Mir\u00f3 and Dali, among others, are manifest in his work. &#151; Lawrence Van Gelder\r\n", "multimedia": null}, {"headline": "Comedian (Movie)  ", "publication_date": "2002-10-11", "byline": "A.

In the company of his peers, Mr. Seinfeld reflects on the hard work and anxiety of his profession, and his efforts to keep his career going are contrasted with the struggle of a young comic named Orny Adams to start one.
