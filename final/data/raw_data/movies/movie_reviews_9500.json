''Time Code'' is at once a mordant satire of the hypocrisy and self-delusion of the film industry and an earnest declaration of faith in the medium itself. In addition to its technical innovations, which test the limits of the human eye, ear and mind, the film boasts some brilliant improvisational acting from its enormous cast. Especially fine are Jean Tripplehorn and Stellan Skarsgard, whose strongly emotional performances add a measure of pathos. Whether ''Time Code'' will ultimately be seen as a bold prophecy of the dawning visual age or as a passionate, gimmicky curio is for the future to decide. At present, though, it's hard to think of a more exciting demonstration of the inexhaustible possibilities of film. &#151; A. O.

Reese Witherspoon, Chloe Sevigny, Samantha Mathis and Cara Seymour give dazzling cameo performances as the unfortunate women in his life.
