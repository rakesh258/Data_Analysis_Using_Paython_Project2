This may be the picture's most serious flaw, since it comes from a man whose worship of action movies from all over the world (but especially Asia) is evident in every frame. Also evident is his obsession with Uma Thurman: by far the most emotionally charged relationship in the movie is the one between the director and his star, who functions as his muse, idol, alter ego and fetish object. Her character, the Bride, is a former assassin whose former lover (that would be Bill) tried to kill her on her wedding day. In this film, the first installment in a two-part revenge epic, the Bride wakes up from a 4-year coma and goes after the hired swords and guns who attacked her. Most of the exposition has been left for Volume Two; this one is an anthology of increasingly violent sequences, some sickening, some rather thrilling, that culminates in a Tokyo nightclub bloodbath  during which Lucy Liu, playing a petite yakuza boss, shows off her Japanese, and also (quite literally) her brains. \u2014 A.

The camera moves through a large, warm home peering into rooms, passing a young woman curled up on the floor in a ball of guilt before coming to rest on a sprawled corpse, blood pooled under its head.  The movie slips back to the familial difficulties involving Fran\u00e7ois (Beno\u00eet Magimel) and the odd bond he has with his luminously beautiful stepsister Mich\u00e8le (M\u00e9lanie Doutey) who's returning home to France after having lived in Chicago for a few years.

Mr. Washington plays the desperation well; it becomes Matt's defining characteristic. And Carl Franklin keeps &quot;Time&quot; breezy enough to fight the oppressive humidity that his cast is obviously laboring under in the Florida sun by keeping the proceedings buoyant. By the time Matt is fighting to hang onto a rapidly crumbling hotel balcony while battling a suspect, you realize that a functioning sense of humor is the classiest touch that a filmmaker could lend to the piled-on plot. \u2014 Elvis Mitchell", "multimedia": null}, {"headline": "Out of the Closet and Working for the Mob", "publication_date": "2003-10-03", "byline": "Dave Kehr", "critics_pick": 0, "date_updated": "2016-03-30 07:05:34", "opening_date": null, "display_title": "Friends and Family", "link": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C03E0DB143CF930A35753C1A9659C8B63", "suggested_link_text": "Read the New York Times Review of Friends and Family", "type": "article"}, "mpaa_rating": "Not Rated", "summary_short": "Stephen (Greg Lauren) and Danny (Christopher Gartin) are a pair of model-handsome gay men, who live in a tastefully appointed townhouse on Stuyvesant Street.  They support their Cole Porter lifestyle by working, improbably, as cold-blooded enforcers for the mob. &quot;Friends and Family&quot; finds it hilarious that homosexuals can be as tough as any Bensonhurst leg-breaker, and the movie's central joke is that Stephen and Danny are much more efficient masters of violence than Vito (Daniel Mastrogiorgio) and Frankie (Lou Carbonneau), the two excessively gentle sons of the Mafia boss Don Patrizzi (Tony Lo Bianco).  But when Stephen's parents come to town for an unexpected visit, the two men must pose as clich\u00e9, mincing homosexuals who run a catering company.  The picture tries to crossbreed two popular subgenres of American farce &#151; the Mafia comedies epitomized by Harold Ramis's &quot;Analyze This&quot; (1999) and the long string of gay coming-out comedies that probably peaked around the time of Mike Nichols's &quot;Birdcage&quot; (1996).  But both strains turn out to be too exhausted to reproduce further, and &quot;Friends and Family&quot; quickly collapses into an overloaded, slow-moving series of predictable jokes and forced situations. &#151; Dave Kehr", "multimedia": null}], "num_results": 20, "status": "OK", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2017 The New York Times Company.
