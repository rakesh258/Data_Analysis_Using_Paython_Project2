Making a gutsy leap into matters of faith, Mr. Smith miraculously emerges with his humor intact and his wings unsinged. \u2014 Janet Maslin", "multimedia": null}, {"headline": "Topsy-Turvy (Movie)  ", "publication_date": "1999-10-02", "byline": "Janet Maslin", "critics_pick": 1, "date_updated": "2016-03-30 07:09:12", "opening_date": "2000-02-11", "display_title": "Topsy-Turvy", "link": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9907E0DD103EF931A35753C1A96F958260", "suggested_link_text": "Read the New York Times Review of Topsy-Turvy", "type": "article"}, "mpaa_rating": "R", "summary_short": "Mike Leigh's grandly entertaining &quot;Topsy-Turvy&quot; is one of those films that create a mix of erudition, pageantry and delectable acting opportunities, much as ''Shakespeare in Love'' did last year.
