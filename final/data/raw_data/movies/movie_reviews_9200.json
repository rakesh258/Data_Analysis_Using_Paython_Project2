It's an anti-romantic comedy that resolves on a minor chord of grief. The premise is as simple as the execution is elegant. A young eye doctor named Du Jiazhen (Rene Liu) disguises her identity slightly (for most of the film she's addressed as Ms. Wu) and advertises for a suitable mate. What she describes as a &quot;momentary slip&quot; and a possible &quot;route to happiness&quot; turns into a kind of sociological experiment as she meets a succession of candidates in a local tea shop. &#151; A.

Michael Douglas is the new American drug czar, Catherine Zeta-Jones the ruthless wife of a busted drug lord and Benicio Del Toro a Mexican policeman. Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman are a team of government agents whose bust of a cynical midlevel dealer (Miguel Ferrer) precipitates much of the drama.
