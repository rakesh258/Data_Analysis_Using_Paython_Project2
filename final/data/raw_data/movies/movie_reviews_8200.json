What is missing, though, is the subtext of sexual and social panic that made the earlier movies so bracing in their silliness. Ms. Zellweger's proto-feminist firebrand, an apostle of sex without love and workplace equality, tangles with Mr. McGregor's playboy journalist, with matrimony the foreordained result.
