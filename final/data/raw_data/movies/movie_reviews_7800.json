Anne Hathaway, the vivacious young star of &quot;The Princess Diaries,&quot; plays the title character, a put-upon teenager in a storybook world whose widowed father (Patrick Bergin) has injudiciously married Dame Olga (Joanna Lumley, of &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot;), the mother of all wicked stepmothers.  She comes complete with a pair of entertainingly hateful daughters (Lucy Punch and Jennifer Higham), who like nothing better than torturing Ella \u2014 particularly once they discover that, thanks to a questionable gift bestowed by a fairy (Vivica A. Fox), she is unable to refuse any order she is given.  As Ella sets out to find the errant fairy and convince her to revoke her dubious present, the screenwriters Laurie Craig, Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith (working from a novel by Gail Carson Levine) take her through various effects-filled realms, including a land where elves are forced by the evil regent to sing, dance and be relentlessly merry, and a forced labor compound for giants that looks disturbingly like a concentration camp.  Mr. O'Haver gives the political subtext a forceful treatment but does not pat himself on the back for it; the messages blend seamlessly into the fantasy and comedy. \u2014 Dave Kehr", "multimedia": null}, {"headline": "When Daddy Belongs to the Bad Guys", "publication_date": "2004-04-09", "byline": "Stephen Holden", "critics_pick": 1, "date_updated": "2016-03-30 07:12:46", "opening_date": "2004-05-07", "display_title": "I'm Not Scared", "link": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9506E6DB1538F93AA35757C0A9629C8B63", "suggested_link_text": "Read the New York Times Review of I'm Not Scared", "type": "article"}, "mpaa_rating": "R", "summary_short": "This visually dazzling thriller set in the extreme south of Italy during the summer gazes at the world through the eyes of Michele (Giuseppe Cristiano), a 10-year-old boy living with his little sister and parents in a tiny impoverished village.

One day he discovers and eventually befriends Filippo (Mattia Di Pierro), a half-blind, frighteningly disheveled boy his own age who is buried in a pit next to an abandoned house where Michele and his friends play daredevil games. Filippo turns out to have been kidnapped.

But Mr. del Toro lets loose with an all-American, vaudevillian rambunctiousness that makes the movie daffy, loose and lovable. The story is pretty complicated stuff: during World War II, Hitler sends a special squad, led by Rasputin (Karel Roden), to rend the dimensional bonds and obtain a creature that will give the edge to the Nazis. His conjuring leads to the emergence of an infant creature, red as sin, with a long tail, who falls into the hands of the Allies. The kindly British scientist Dr. Broom (John Hurt) tames the tiny scarlet devil with a Baby Ruth the size of a Bazooka. Adopted by Dr. Broom, Hellboy, with his huge stone-like left arm, grows up to be the go-to guy for the good doctor and the anti-apparition league known as the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense.
