The film follows a group of women through their grueling schedules in the financial world. By the time it burrows more specifically into the lives of the four subjects &#151; the New York Stock Exchange floor broker Louise Jones, the equity research analyst Carol Warner Wilke, the foreign exchange sales trader Kimberley Euston and the Wharton School business student Umber Ahmad &#151; the movie is far more watchable. Perhaps it's understandable that the directors want to establish a context to the demands of Wall Street, an environment with an atmosphere as dense and troublesome as the gravity of Jupiter. The withering compromise comes from self-generated stress, especially given that discrimination isn't as overt as it used to be on Wall Street &#151; though the number of women is still small. The burdens the subjects place on themselves, in attempts to juggle personal and work existences, is brutal and more informative than the prologue tutorial. The flux in the subjects' lives, and the determination that put them in such rarified positions, is what gives &quot;Risk&quot; some needed roughage. Much of the film takes place in the summer; Ms. Warner Wilke's husband jokes that they sure are glad their children were born in July or August, when things are slower but, as we learn, not much slower. She's striving to be included in a magazine's upcoming ranking of financial figures. The directors catch Ms. Jones on her annual return to the Upper West Side location where she was abandoned as a 2-day-old. She's in the midst of selling her company to a larger firm and contemplating motherhood. The moderately arresting &quot;Risk&quot; at times appears to suffer from a lack of resources and seems to be writ small, suggesting that it may play better on television. &#151; Elvis Mitchell", "multimedia": null}, {"headline": "Art Imitates Life in the Nevada Desert", "publication_date": "2004-02-27", "byline": "Stephen Holden", "critics_pick": 0, "date_updated": "2016-03-30 06:53:56", "opening_date": "2003-10-23", "display_title": "Confessions of a Burning Man", "link": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C0CEFDE113CF934A15751C0A9629C8B63", "suggested_link_text": "Read the New York Times Review of Confessions of a Burning Man", "type": "article"}, "mpaa_rating": "", "summary_short": "This incoherent documentary about the annual Burning Man arts festival in the northern Nevada desert makes the fatal flaw of cinematically imitating the anarchistic spirit of the event it observes.

But pleasure also becomes business, as the two young women resolve to use their sexual powers to conquer the male-dominated business world, embodied by a private bank where Sandrine gets a job as a secretary and begins seducing her way to the top. Mr. Brisseau may pay lip service to post-feminist ideas of female empowerment through seduction, though his actual concerns seem to be less intellectual than frankly carnal.  As the two friends compete to see who will be the first to conquer and tame the elusive Christophe (a Sadean libertine in his own right), Mr. Brisseau stages some rousingly voyeuristic sex scenes that, while they stop short of hardcore pornography, feature combinations seldom seen outside the oeuvre of Jenna Jameson.  Viewers of &quot;Secret Things&quot; will find it impossible not to allow a snicker to escape occasionally, as the film's lurid plotline unfolds into ever more preposterous developments.  But there is no denying the force of Mr. Brisseau's bizarre imagination and the personal conviction he brings to it. &#151; Dave Kehr", "multimedia": null}, {"headline": "A Frankenstein Story for the Digital Age", "publication_date": "2004-02-20", "byline": "Dave Kehr", "critics_pick": 0, "date_updated": "2016-03-30 06:44:28", "opening_date": "2010-10-26", "display_title": "Teknolust", "link": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9F06E1D9113DF933A15751C0A9629C8B63", "suggested_link_text": "Read the New York Times Review of Teknolust", "type": "article"}, "mpaa_rating": "R", "summary_short": "A minor addition to the tiny genre of feminist science fiction films, &quot;Teknolust&quot; is a benign, digital-age Frankenstein story about a mousy genetic research scientist, Rosetta Stone (the stunning Tilda Swinton, struggling to look plain by donning a curly wig and oversized glasses), who uses her own DNA to create three color-coded clones.  Written and directed by Lynn Hershman Leeson, who guided Ms. Swinton to a more effective performance in the 1998 &quot;Conceiving Ada,&quot; &quot;Teknolust&quot; has a lot on its mind but little on the ball when it comes to transforming thematic notions into dramatic concepts.  The most aggressive of the clones, Ruby, becomes infatuated with an irritatingly incompetent copy shop employee (ok, we got it) played by the perpetually twitchy Jeremy Davies.  Love, it seems, will help her to become real, like some sort of hormonally charged Pinocchio.  There's some potential for entertainment here, but Ms. Leeson's emphatic direction draws much of the fun from the comedy elements.  Even Ms. Swinton, usually the most restrained and elegant of performers, can be found mugging outrageously as she strains to put over the less-than-convulsive laugh lines. &#151; Dave Kehr", "multimedia": null}, {"headline": "Coping in a Land That's Not Quite Heaven", "publication_date": "2004-02-18", "byline": "Elvis Mitchell", "critics_pick": 1, "date_updated": "2016-03-30 07:22:24", "opening_date": null, "display_title": "Lost Boys of Sudan", "link": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9904E4DF153DF93BA25751C0A9629C8B63", "suggested_link_text": "Read the New York Times Review of Lost Boys of Sudan", "type": "article"}, "mpaa_rating": "Not Rated", "summary_short": "When one of the hopeful teenagers in this film, talking about his upcoming trip to America, remarks that &quot;The journey is like you are going to heaven,&quot; your heart sinks.  But in this well-organized and fascinating movie, the tidy and intelligent filmmakers Megan Mylan and Jon Shenk follow the accretions of small defeats that don't sap the will of the young Africans transplanted to the United States to make a better life for themselves. &quot;You are the future of Sudan,&quot; the boys are told as they prepare to leave their homeland. The film, which primarily follows two of the boys, Peter and Santino, over the course of a year, doesn't make us dread that line about a heaven that may not materialize. At its core, &quot;Sudan&quot; becomes about coping with loneliness, as alienation increases and both young men \u2014 like their newly arrived tribesmen \u2014 are orphaned into trying to stay afloat. Hearing the African teenagers joke about the customs they can no longer observe \u2014 like the familiar touching considered homosexual behavior in America \u2014 only italicizes the spiritual distance between America and Africa. The nearly unlimited access the directors have to the lives of their subjects intensifies the narrative, because it allows us to drift along in the swells and eddies of Peter and Santino's time in the United States. The filmmakers don't shy away from touchy issues, like the schism between the Sudanese and American blacks. Subtly, &quot;Lost Boys of Sudan&quot; provides a sense of what its subjects have traded \u2014 sacrificed, really \u2014 to come to America. Getting an audience so caught up is no small feat, and a tribute to the directors' storytelling. And though that early reference to heaven on earth \u2014 hovering and poised for contradiction \u2014 is answered by the end of &quot;Sudan,&quot; by then the film has earned the right to do so. \u2014 Elvis Mitchell", "multimedia": null}], "num_results": 20, "status": "OK", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2017 The New York Times Company.
