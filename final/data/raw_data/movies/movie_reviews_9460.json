Even if you're not, its seductive lack of pretension will win you over. ''Groove'' is a comedy of moments, tracking a crowd through the ups and downs of one night of pleasure at a rave. Greg Harrison and his team don't try to pretend that raves are anything new or dangerous. Rather, they're an entrenched circuit with specific tribal complications, and this genial picture captures them. %#151; Elvis Mitchell", "multimedia": null}, {"headline": "Children of Chabannes, The (Documentary Film)  ", "publication_date": "2000-06-09", "byline": "A.

After the glum bullying of ''Gladiator'' and the noisy bombast of ''M:I-2,'' it's refreshing to see a movie so good-natured, so confident in its ability to provoke not queasy awe or numb exhaustion, but pure delight. &#151 A.
