One is the handsome, courtly son (Patrick Dempsey) of the mayor of New York who showers her with roses and diamonds, the other her childhood sweetheart, the hunky Southern stud (Josh Lucas) she left behind. Things are on course for her to marry the mayor's son until she returns to Pigeon Creek, Ala., to divorce the childhood sweetheart and discovers the flame still flickers. A star to her petite bones, Ms. Witherspoon charms her way through this wisp of a movie that peddles a faux populist sentimentality while jokingly refighting the Civil War with Melanie the winning side's trophy. \u2014 Stephen Holden\r\n", "multimedia": null}, {"headline": "Just a Kiss (Movie)  ", "publication_date": "2002-09-27", "byline": "Stephen Holden", "critics_pick": 0, "date_updated": "2016-03-30 06:44:02", "opening_date": null, "display_title": "Just a Kiss", "link": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C0DE4DD1F39F934A1575AC0A9649C8B63", "suggested_link_text": "Read the New York Times Review of Just a Kiss", "type": "article"}, "mpaa_rating": "R", "summary_short": "&quot;Just a Kiss,&quot; an urban sex comedy that is a little too smart for its own good, reminds us that members of Manhattan's 30-something semi-hipoisie are just as prone to infidelity and ranting sexual jealousy as the low-rent domestic warriors in a Jerry Springer sideshow. These urbanites' language may be sharper and their games more refined, but their emotions are just as raw. This movie, directed by the actor Fisher Stevens from a screenplay by Patrick Breen, crisscrosses the romantic lives of a gallery of sharply drawn New York caricatures whose tit-for-tat bed hopping eventually lands three of them in the hospital. What elevates the movie above the run-of-the-mill singles blender is its surreal sense of humor and technological finish. Before it ends, the movie allows its characters to go back in time and make different, less destructive choices. &#151; Stephen Holden\r\n", "multimedia": null}, {"headline": "Moonlight Mile (Movie)  ", "publication_date": "2002-09-27", "byline": "A.

Though its conclusion is too tidily therapeutic, and though elements of its story strain credibility, &quot;Moonlight Mile&quot; has an understated, lived-in quality, and a wry, unforced sense of the absurd. The soundtrack, of early 1970's album cuts certainly helps.  Jake Gyllenhaal's performance as the fianc&#233;, in particular, is smart and unpredictable, a portrait of Vietnam-era youthful indecision that reminds you of the young Dustin Hoffman. The real Mr. Hoffman, meanwhile, plays the murder victim's father, who clings to his not-quite-son-in-law as a way of holding onto his lost daughter. \u2014 A. O.
