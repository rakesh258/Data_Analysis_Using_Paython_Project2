The director has a fine sense of place and regards the quirks and delusions of this remote rural town with a native's mixture of affection and impatience. The film, written by Mr. Hess, a 24-year-old former student at Brigham Young University, and his 23-year-old wife, Jerusha, works best as a series of deadpan visual and verbal gags. Even the trained actors in the cast perform with the hesitant, awkward opacity of non-professionals, and their awkwardness is clearly, for Mr. Hess, a sign of authenticity. His own considerable talent could use a bit more polish. There are some dull stretches, and the fairy-tale ending does not seem entirely earned.

Begun in 1957 as a backyard bohemian romp starring the avant-garde legend Jack Smith &#151; an amazing proto-drag performer who later directed his own underground classic, &quot;Flaming Creatures&quot; &#151; the project grew over the years to include huge chunks of appropriated material, including, for example, the entirety of Richard Nixon's 1952 Checkers speech and what seems like most of an early 1930's documentary on what was then known as &quot;darkest Africa.&quot;  For this provisionally definitive version, Mr. Jacobs has brought his film up to date with topical references to the war in Iraq and the Bush administration.  Whether or not this is the final cut of &quot;Star Spangled to Death&quot; (Mr. Jacobs is a youthful 70, with plenty of time for further modifications), it stands as a rare living, breathing example of American avant-garde filmmaking, a species unfortunately well on its way to extinction. &#151; Dave Kehr", "multimedia": null}, {"headline": "A Couple Who View Risk as the Ultimate Romance", "publication_date": "2004-05-21", "byline": "Stephen Holden", "critics_pick": 0, "date_updated": "2016-03-30 07:22:29", "opening_date": "2004-05-28", "display_title": "Love Me If You Dare", "link": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9F00E5D6103FF932A15756C0A9629C8B63", "suggested_link_text": "Read the New York Times Review of Love Me If You Dare", "type": "article"}, "mpaa_rating": "R", "summary_short": "Only the French, those self-proclaimed sages of  &quot;l'amour fou,&quot; would dream of concocting a surreal romantic allegory like this grown-up fairy tale. The rococo fantasy, tricked out with animation and with actors sailing like little Supermen through toy cutout clouds, belongs to the same school of whimsical excess as  &quot;The Umbrellas of Cherbourg&quot; and &quot;Amelie.&quot; But as the movie glides along, its story turns considerably darker than its fluffy, candy-colored forerunners. Narrated by its  protagonist (Guillaume Canet), the movie follows the increasingly destructive games of one-upmanship he plays over three decades with his closest childhood friend (Marion  Cotillard). The two meet as 8-year-old children and enter a private world in which  they dare each other to carry out increasingly outrageous pranks. On one level, the movie  is a parable of the battle of the sexes. On another it portrays the insanity of any romantic  quest (they love each other but can't say it) in which the postponement of fulfillment  becomes a desperate end in itself. &#151; Stephen Holden", "multimedia": null}], "num_results": 20, "status": "OK", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2017 The New York Times Company.
