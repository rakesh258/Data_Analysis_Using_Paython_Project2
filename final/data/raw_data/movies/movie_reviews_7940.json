Edward is a devoted teller of tall tales, which charms everyone except his son, Will (Billy Crudup), who must overcome this estrangement before his father's death. There is an interesting family drama hidden behind all the whimsy and moonshine, but the movie is so steadfast in its admiration for Edward and his inventions that it never considers that Will might have a point. The movie, in consequence, lacks one, as it wanders through a series of cute, fairy-tale episodes, featuring, among other things, a glass-eyed witch, a pair of conjoined Korean chanteuses, and a town where nobody wears shoes. Tim Burton's imagination, so wild and marvelous in movies like &quot;Pee Wee's Big Adventure,&quot; &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot; and &quot;Beetlejuice,&quot; seems to have been tamed. Rather than resonating with the uncanny magic of the unconscious, his images seem to be part of a strategy of denial, designed to obscure the possibility that Edward, a charismatic raconteur, might also be a narcissist and a compulsive liar. Will might forgive these lapses \u2014 that is a son's prerogative, after all. Far worse, from the audience's point of view, is that Edward is also a bit of a bore. \u2014 A. O.

Years later, the realtor Jim Evers (Mr. Murphy) is summoned to Gracey Manor with his wife, Sara (Marsha Thomason); tough-girl daughter, Megan (Aree Davis); and son, Michael (Marc John Jeffries). And the breathtaking Sara has an amazing resemblance to the late lady of the manor. &quot;Mansion&quot; is a movie that doesn't really want to evoke reaction - it lacks even the cheesy fear quotient that a film like &quot;Abbott and Costello Meet the Mummy&quot; could dredge up. And Mr. Murphy is left to fall back on his mechanical sketch version of displaying terror, which only makes the picture seem even more insubstantial. \u2014 Elvis Mitchell", "multimedia": null}, {"headline": "To a Guy Who Banks on Bad Luck, Good Luck Can Be Bad", "publication_date": "2003-11-26", "byline": "A.

Macy plays Jerry Lootz, a man so thoroughly unlucky that he is the cause of bad luck in others. In hock to a slick, thuggish casino manager (Alec Baldwin), Jerry works as a cooler, foiling the winning streaks of customers whose good fortune threatens the house s take. His own luck begins to change when a cocktail waitress named Natalie (Maria  Bello) takes him to bed, and then falls in love with him in spite of herself. The setting- -Las Vegas with its sleazy, lowlife glamour- -feels a bit tired, and the story is hokey, but Wayne Kramer, making his feature debut as a director, reins in his gimmicky instincts enough to allow the skill of the actors to shine through the drab indie-noir conventions. Mr. Baldwin plays his villainous role with subdued relish, and Mr. Macy and Ms. Bello settle comfortably into their characters, giving them an appealing, lived-in glow. \u2014 A. O.

The expedition is  dispatched to retrieve a distinguished professor who got stuck in the past and left an  S.O.S., which his protege discovers on a dig. When the movie's interminable battle  scenes between the French and the English pause, two pairs of cardboard lovebirds grab  the chance to steal a smooch.
