Lounging around in a paisley dressing gown, dropping pallid witticisms in Grant's  signature staccato style with just the right accent, the actor finds an easy balance between  affectionate imitation and amusing parody. That ghost haunts the movie's troubled young  protagonist Alim (Jimi Mistry), a gay South Asian Muslim leaving with a British lover in  London. The movie is the latest manifestation of an already stale sub-sub genre: the  multicultural romance in which a gay couple of mixed ethnicity tries to conceal their  relationship from visiting tradition-bound relatives who assume the lovers are  heterosexual roommates. Mr. MacLachlan's Grant is Alim's imaginary advisor. The humor fizzles, and except for Mr. MacLachlan the acting is wooden and overstated. &#151; Stephen Holden", "multimedia": null}, {"headline": "Bollywood Discovers New Jersey's Subplots", "publication_date": "2004-07-16", "byline": "Dave Kehr", "critics_pick": 0, "date_updated": "2016-03-30 06:58:11", "opening_date": "2004-07-16", "display_title": "Flavors", "link": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9A02E6DE143AF935A25754C0A9629C8B63", "suggested_link_text": "Read the New York Times Review of Flavors", "type": "article"}, "mpaa_rating": "", "summary_short": "Written and directed by Raj Nidimoru and Krishna DK, this independent feature &#151; a product of the Indian Diaspora &#151; was shot and takes place largely in New Jersey, where the thoroughly Americanized Rad (Anupam Mittal) is about to be married to his tall, blonde American fianc\u00e9e (Jicky Schnee).

Part of  the story revolves around the tug of war between his domineering mother (Ghita Norby)  and his beautiful wife (Lisa Werlinder), who puts her promising acting career on hold to move from Stockholm to Copenhagen. &quot;The Inheritance&quot; reminds you in painful detail that one of the tasks of a financially responsible executive is to execute.

In answer, this intelligent, hectoring documentary offers an elaborate psychopathology of dishonest, unscrupulous and predatory behaviors, which are seen as expressions of the corporation's fundamental nature. Case studies in environmental pollution, aggressive branding, the exploitation of workers and the abuse of technology alternate with more general disquisitions on the brutal logic of global capitalism. The talking heads are mainly activists and scholars \u2014 Noam Chomsky, Naomi Klein and Michael Moore, among others \u2014 with a few C.E.O.'s and orthodox economists thrown in for balance. While much of the material is persuasive, the film ensnares itself in contradictions it does not acknowledge, and paints a grim, tendentious picture of the modern world. Even Marx recognized the creative, liberating force of capitalism, and without some acknowledgement of the comforts, conveniences and pleasures that corporations provide, it is hard to understand their power or, for that matter, to oppose it effectively. \u2014 A.
