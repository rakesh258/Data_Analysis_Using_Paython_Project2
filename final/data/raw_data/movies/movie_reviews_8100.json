The towering, action-packed logo is a further sardonic comment on the lack of activity in the protagonist's life. There's as much at stake in this hilarious, moody and cantankerous film adaptation of &quot;Splendor&quot; as there was in this summer's other movies of comics anti-heroes like &quot;The Hulk&quot; and &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.&quot; Harvey is extraordinary \u2014 by the way, so is this movie. As played by Paul Giamatti, Harvey's a gray wad of anger that spends his time in his cave-like apartment, with shelves sagging under the weight of his collection of record albums and jazz 78's. And sputtering to his equally powerless pals about a world that he refuses to understand. Slumped into a posture that's a question mark with a pot-belly, Mr. Giamatti's a frustrated tremor, shaking and gesticulating futilely. The filmmakers use the real Mr. Pekar as a narrator initially. For a time, the film cuts to the real-life Pekar, fulminating onscreen with his friends against a stark-white background. This sounds like a mocking, distancing device \u2014 and in the wrong hands, it would be. But the real-life Pekar is as vivid in his way as Mr. Giamatti. The actual Pekaris a flinty crank spouting while the actors portraying figures from the streets of Cleveland chuckle in disbelief at him and his obsessive, nerdy friends, like Toby (played in the film with breath-taking precision by Judah Friedlander). The great cast also includes Earl Billings as Mr. Boats, one of Harvey bellicose, small-minded and larger-than-life co-workers, and Danny Hoch. Harvey's romantic match, Joyce Brabner, is played with a tart, intriguing directness by Hope Davis that's equal parts Emma Goldman and Olive Oyl \u2014  that is, the Olive Oyl of the comics, not the screaming helpless No. 2 pencil of the cartoons. And the picture becomes something richer and fuller when Joyce enters the film. Harvey has someone to square off with, and her eccentricities complement his. \u2014 Elvis Mitchell", "multimedia": null}, {"headline": "Thornton Wilder Passes a Tough High School Test", "publication_date": "2003-08-15", "byline": "A.

This movie, about a jewel thief named Valentin (Jeremy Irons) and a cabaret singer named Jane (Patricia Kaas), might have been called &quot;Another Man and a Different Woman.&quot; The two of them drift, in a state of elegant melancholy, through various picturesque places, including Paris, London and Fez, where they finally meet, drawn together by a mysterious memory disorder. The movie is sublimely silly  &#151; as empty, elegant and beguiling as a magazine advertisement for an expensive watch &#151; but the director's evident pleasure, his impeccable CinemaScope compositions and the lush, suave score by Michel Legrand make it a seductive diversion. &#151; A.O.

Returning as Mr. Rodriguez's tweener protagonists are Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara as Carmen and Juni Cortez, sister and brother junior agents for the top-secret O.S.S. agency who step in for their overworked parents, played by Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino, whenever national security requires extra reinforcement. \u2014 Dave Kehr", "multimedia": null}, {"headline": "Insects Rule on the Giant Screen", "publication_date": "2003-07-25", "byline": "Elvis Mitchell", "critics_pick": 0, "date_updated": "2016-03-30 06:54:31", "opening_date": null, "display_title": "Bugs!", "link": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C0CE3DD133FF936A15754C0A9659C8B63", "suggested_link_text": "Read the New York Times Review of Bugs!", "type": "article"}, "mpaa_rating": "", "summary_short": "This documentary look at the insect world is the newest 3-D Imax spectacular, which means the bugs are roughly the size of a Cadillac Escalade, crawling over leaves bigger than most Manhattan studio apartments. This makes sense, since the insects inhabiting the screen and chomping away on garbage, grass and eventually each other in the Borneo rainforest can probably be found in many Manhattan studio apartments. Vivid and visually stunning, &quot;Bugs!&quot; is fun in the same self-satisfied and awe-struck way that most Imax movies are, seeming to be a cross between an infomercial and an Animal Planet documentary.  Judi Dench intones the narration with distracted urgency &#151; she sometimes sounds as if she's reading the script while working out a difficult crossword puzzle clue. At least she never has to say &quot;It's a jungle out there&quot; while the insects fly, trundle and crawl through the forbidding exteriors where &quot;Bugs!&quot; was filmed. The jokes get enough emphasis from the large camera lenses that capture the action. &#151; Elvis Mitchell", "multimedia": null}], "num_results": 20, "status": "OK", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2017 The New York Times Company.
