Of course, she cutely confesses in her voice-over narration, she is desperately lonely and hasn't had sex in years. This movie is Ms. Davis's fourth film as a director (her work includes the 2001 &quot;All Over the Guy&quot;), and she has a bright, chipper style that keeps things moving, while never quite managing to connect her wish-fulfilling characters to the human race.
