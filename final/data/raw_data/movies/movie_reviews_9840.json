All this re-examination of the atmosphere of the post-Sputnik era is wrapped up in the story of a bright (and therefore unpopular) little boy who befriends a 50-foot-tall iron robot from who knows where that plunges into the sea one stormy night in 1957 and comes ashore near Rockwell, Me. The boy, Hogarth Hughes, saves the giant when it becomes entangled in high-tension wires, and the big lug becomes his secret playmate. Meanwhile, a nasty, paranoid Government agent is closing in on the giant, leading to a showdown with the military. &quot;The Iron Giant&quot; is a smooth, skilled example of animated filmmaking. Many parents will doubtless approve of the film's messages while they ponder how the passing years have smoothed the jagged edges of history. \u2014 Lawrence Van Gelder", "multimedia": null}, {"headline": "Gambler, The (Movie)  ", "publication_date": "1999-08-04", "byline": "STEPHEN HOLDEN", "critics_pick": 0, "date_updated": "2016-03-30 07:26:48", "opening_date": null, "display_title": "The Gambler", "link": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D01E7DD1F31F937A3575BC0A96F958260", "suggested_link_text": "Read the New York Times Review of The Gambler", "type": "article"}, "mpaa_rating": "R", "summary_short": "Student transcribes Dostoyevsky's novel.", "multimedia": null}, {"headline": "Runaway Bride (Movie)  ", "publication_date": "1999-07-30", "byline": "Janet Maslin", "critics_pick": 0, "date_updated": "2016-03-30 07:28:30", "opening_date": "1999-07-30", "display_title": "Runaway Bride", "link": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9902E0DC1431F933A05754C0A96F958260", "suggested_link_text": "Read the New York Times Review of Runaway Bride", "type": "article"}, "mpaa_rating": "PG", "summary_short": "Reporter falls for woman who keeps leaving grooms at altar.
