No sooner has Eddie recovered than his boss informs him he is no longer insurable for transporting merchandise worth more than a million dollars and that perhaps some new arrangement might be worked out. Eddie must train his much younger replacement, Bobby Walker (Donnie Wahlberg), by taking him on the road and showing him the ropes. The core of &quot;Diamond Men&quot; is the story of Eddie and Bobby's rocky relationship. - Stephen Holden\r\n", "multimedia": null}, {"headline": "Texas Night Train (Movie)  ", "publication_date": "2001-09-21", "byline": "Lawrence Van Gelder", "critics_pick": 0, "date_updated": "2016-03-30 07:12:41", "opening_date": null, "display_title": "Texas Night Train", "link": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E03E2DC113BF932A1575AC0A9679C8B63", "suggested_link_text": "Read the New York Times Review of Texas Night Train", "type": "article"}, "mpaa_rating": "", "summary_short": "", "multimedia": null}, {"headline": "Go Tigers!
