It can make your own life feel as empty and attenuated as those of the people trying to eke out an existence on the screen. The movie could be compared to Woody Allen's commitment-phobic and love-starved residents of contemporary Manhattan, but it is really more along the lines of what &quot;Friends&quot; would be like if the cast actually had to live in New York City and not luxuriate in those apparently rent-controlled back-lot palazzos. &#151; Elvis Mitchell", "multimedia": null}, {"headline": "Shrek (Movie)  ", "publication_date": "2001-05-16", "byline": "Elvis Mitchell", "critics_pick": 1, "date_updated": "2016-03-30 06:55:05", "opening_date": "2001-05-18", "display_title": "Shrek", "link": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9F00E3DD153AF935A25756C0A9679C8B63", "suggested_link_text": "Read the New York Times Review of Shrek", "type": "article"}, "mpaa_rating": "PG", "summary_short": "The filmmaking team behind &quot;Shrek&quot; takes the bare bones of William Stieg's children's book about an ogre who thinks filthiness is next to godliness and uses that as a taking-off point for a new animated film that rejoices in its own brand of perversity.
