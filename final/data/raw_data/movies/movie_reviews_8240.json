Their homeroom-based guile finally leads Ben, who eventually wants to break free, into one last, potentially liberating crime.

Set in Bangladesh in the 1960's, &quot;The Clay Bird&quot; questions the nature of dedication to Islam. It doesn't attack fealty but eventually rebukes zealotry by showing a boy's reaction to his father's recent total immersion.  Anu (Nurul Islam Bablu) is sent off to a religious school by his father, Kazi (Jayanto Chattopadhyay). Kazi doesn't want his son tainted by the outside world. His obedient though doubtful wife, Ayesha (Rokeya Prachy), quietly expresses through frowns her concern about Kazi's close-minded new seriousness. She gently reasons with her boy, and the bright Anu resigns himself to his new life.  Mr. Masud's sensitivity gives the film a pungent emotional clarity; he recognizes that na\u00efvet\u00e9 isn't a province only of childhood. Kazi's a na\u00eff, too, and learns the hard way that following a path without independent thought is a fool's errand.
