The plot complications include Lance's trying to court an African-American social activist (Regina King) while he's trapped in the body of a white man, and still get onstage at the Apollo. There are a few funny ideas, which are reminiscent of the deadly riffing that Rock is capable of, and he shows new confidence as an actor. This picture, by the directors of &quot;American Pie,&quot; doesn't quite work as a romantic comedy: it's a little timid and recycled, despite some great supporting performances by Eugene Levy, Wanda Sykes and Mark Addy. \u2014 Elvis Mitchell\r\n", "multimedia": null}, {"headline": "Sweet November (Movie)  ", "publication_date": "2001-02-16", "byline": "A.
