Costner's moving to the sidelines is as ostentatious as his Boston Brahmin accent \u2014 he seems to be channeling Vaughn Meader. But the director Roger Donaldson, despite having more confrontation scenes than all of the other Kennedy dramatization projects combined, brings an athletic rigor to the film.
