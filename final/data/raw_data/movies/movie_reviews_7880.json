But then Drew Barrymore shows up as Lucy, a lovely art teacher suffering from temporal lobe damage, and everything starts looking up. She goes after Mr. Schneider with a baseball bat, and engages Mr. Sandler, who plays an easy-going, womanizing veterinarian, in a clever and touching romantic comedy. The film's conceit \u2014 Lucy's injury has destroyed her short-term memory, so that she starts each day with no recollection of the one before \u2014 is reminiscent of Harold Ramis's immortal &quot;Groundhog Day.&quot; While &quot;50 First Dates,&quot; deftly directed by Peter Segal from George Wing's witty and heartfelt script, does not have that film's philosophical ambitions, it does follow its premise to a risky conclusion that pays off beautifully. \u2014 A.

The loner Kenneth (Desmond Harrington), who labors as a technical writer in Los Angeles decides to order an inanimate physical companion, an anatomically correct doll that he names Nikki. Kenneth, as slender as a riding crop, throws himself into his relationship with Nikki with loving devotion; it's a stand-in for a close encounter with Lisa (Melissa Sagemiller), who works in the same office that he does. Having Nikki around the house for his reindeer games helps Kenneth to open up, and gives him the nerve to ask Lisa out. When he gets to know her, Nikki starts to strike out in jealousy &#151; or does she? &#151; and Kenneth's natural discomfort level redlines. Mr. Parigi keeps a chill in the meager proceedings. One of the most disturbing elements of the movie comes from the fact that Nikki looks like an extravagant line item in the &quot;Love Object&quot; budget. You get the sense that the unliving doll has to be returned to a warehouse with as few scuffs as, um, humanly possible. The modestly assembled film is only periodically derailed because of its tone; the writer/director sometimes overplays the humor in the midst of all the deadpan. Occasionally, the movie seems to be parodying itself &#151; a danger of slim-budget affairs where we can almost see a meter ticking away the dollars, and you feel you've spent almost as much on admission as the filmmaker did completing the project.

The wan, gray skies and omnipresent squalor give the movie the feel of a black and white film, though splashes of color filter through occasionally. When someone does get around to remaking &quot;Shaft&quot; \u2014 and the film deserves such revisiting \u2014 let's hope the new version doesn't implode from gooey or overstated emotion.  &quot;Shaft&quot; deftly swings to a spartan, engrossing climax, and the final twists spell out what the murderers are made of and the setting responsible for them in the first place: a true piece of film magic. \u2014 Elvis Mitchell", "multimedia": null}, {"headline": "A Dollar, a Dream, a Brooklyn Bo\u00eete", "publication_date": "2004-01-30", "byline": "Elvis Mitchell", "critics_pick": 0, "date_updated": "2016-03-30 06:41:40", "opening_date": "2004-01-30", "display_title": "Eat This New York", "link": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C0DEFD91038F933A05752C0A9629C8B63", "suggested_link_text": "Read the New York Times Review of Eat This New York", "type": "article"}, "mpaa_rating": "Not Rated", "summary_short": "It will be impossible for you to walk past a shuttered restaurant and not feel a chill after seeing this documentary. The directors may not be great filmmakers &#151; it's hard to tell based on the bare bones picture they shot here &#151; but they know a great story, and more important, how to tell it. The movie will grip those fascinated by the restaurant business, and those who merely drift by the Food Network on the way to MoreMax or Speedvision on the cable dial. The directors demonstrate an eye for intriguing real-life drama. They get it from the film's subjects, John McCormick and Billy Phelps. The men are a pair of starry-eyed, eager would-be restaurateurs from Minnesota opening a new spot in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. As they discuss their thoughts for their slice-shaped eatery, they're like the young sisters in Jim Sheridan's &quot;In America,&quot; their eyes gleaming with joy over a first glimpse of  the Manhattan skyline. They plant their flag far from the madding crowd. &quot;I have no food experience, no restaurant experience,&quot; Mr. Phelps admits, and then adds, &quot;I don't know how many local customers we'll get there.&quot; The movie's subtle subtext is that restaurants are as big a reason for coming to New York as starting a band or writing a novel, only the dining path is far more treacherous. &#151; Elvis Mitchell", "multimedia": null}, {"headline": "A Hip-Hop Dance Team Duels Some Menacing White Boys", "publication_date": "2004-01-30", "byline": "Dave Kehr", "critics_pick": 0, "date_updated": "2016-03-30 06:54:49", "opening_date": "2004-01-30", "display_title": "You Got Served", "link": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9406E6D91038F933A05752C0A9629C8B63", "suggested_link_text": "Read the New York Times Review of You Got Served", "type": "article"}, "mpaa_rating": "PG-13", "summary_short": "This modest programmer directed by Christopher B. Stokes showcases the latest developments in hip-hop street dance, which, much like hip-hop music, appears to be a largely masculine domain.  Apart from a few token women in the chorus, the boys dominate the performance with cutting, slashing, robotic moves that evoke both Chinese martial arts films and Michael Jackson's undying &quot;moonwalk&quot; move.  The presentation is aggressive and confrontational, and the dancers perform without ever breaking their scowling, angry street faces.  The thin plot revolves around the bust up of best friends Elgin (Marques Houston, of the hip-hop group IMx) and David (Omari Grandberry of B2K) over David's determination to date Elgin's dazzling kid sister Liyah (Jennifer Freeman).

Christian, played by the former soap opera star Wes Ramsey, is that stock figure of gay drama, the hopelessly handsome party boy whose life is devoted to casual sex.  A waiter in a Los Angeles restaurant, owned and operated by the radiantly maternal Lila (the always welcome Jacqueline Bisset), Christian accepts a $50 wager from his co-workers that he will be able to seduce the apparently straight Mormon missionary, Aaron (Steve Sandvoss), who has moved into the apartment opposite his.  Needless to say, what begins as a cynical bet develops into a deep romance.  After some initial resistance, Aaron surrenders to Christian's charms, discovering his own homosexuality in the process.  At the same time, Christian discovers, in Aaron's sincerity and innocence, the deeper values that have been missing from his own life.  The writer-director, C. Jay Cox, knows his formulas a bit too well for his own good, and the film's reliance on coincidence and contrivance, particularly in its forced final third, gets in the way of his low key, naturalistic direction. &#151; Dave Kehr", "multimedia": null}, {"headline": "Hitting the Beach to Enjoy a Little Laid-Back Larceny", "publication_date": "2004-01-30", "byline": "A.

Owen Wilson gives his usual smart, lazy thing as a small time crook mixed up with some shady doings, and Morgan Freeman, as the mentor who may in fact be his nemesis, is as wry and mellow as ever. Sara Foster, a former magazine model, slips into the relaxed vibe and out of whatever flimsy beachwear she has on.
