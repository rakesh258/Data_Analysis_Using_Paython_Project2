The ugly nugget at the center of the story is that Heidi wasn't an orphan; her Vietnamese mother, Mai Thi Kim, was one among many coerced into giving up their children. &quot;Daughter&quot; may not be a great piece of filmmaking, but its power comes from its soul's-eye view of how well-meaning patronizing masked a social injustice, at least as represented by this case. \u2014 Elvis Mitchell", "multimedia": null}, {"headline": "Jim Brown: All American (Movie) ", "publication_date": "2002-03-22", "byline": "Stephen Holden", "critics_pick": 1, "date_updated": "2016-03-30 06:45:43", "opening_date": null, "display_title": "Jim Brown: All American", "link": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9A04E1D71138F931A15750C0A9649C8B63", "suggested_link_text": "Read the New York Times Review of Jim Brown: All American", "type": "article"}, "mpaa_rating": "", "summary_short": "Spike Lee's thoughtful, adulatory video documentary of the football legend, who is now 66, feels like two movies stuck together.
