He plays Michael Jennings, a hotshot inventor who steals the ideas and properties of other corporations, and refines them for competitors.

When a new, less dangerous procedure comes along \u2014 one that can safely do away with three years, instead of a few months \u2014 Michael is invited by an old friend to get involved in a project that could potentially change the world, and net Michael an eight-figure income.

The material comes packed with dramatic possibilities and rich metaphors, but Mr. Roy focuses most of his energy on caricaturing his wealthy former friends.  You would probably have to go back to the Soviet propaganda of the 1920's to find more a vicious treatment of the British aristocracy, who are here portrayed as cocaine-sniffing, wife-swapping, servant-beating decadents, for whom snobbery is more than a way of life &#151; it's a religion. Like Mike Figgis's &quot;Timecode,&quot; the film is presented in a split screen format, a device that seems both distracting and dishonest, since the soundtrack, switching from channel to channel, is used to guide the spectator's attention just as firmly as traditional editing techniques. &#151; Dave Kehr", "multimedia": null}, {"headline": "Putting a Smiley Face on a Nazi Camp", "publication_date": "2003-12-12", "byline": "Elvis Mitchell", "critics_pick": 0, "date_updated": "2016-03-30 07:15:08", "opening_date": null, "display_title": "Prisoner of Paradise", "link": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C03E6D8173CF931A25751C1A9659C8B63", "suggested_link_text": "Read the New York Times Review of Prisoner of Paradise", "type": "article"}, "mpaa_rating": "", "summary_short": "This holocaust documentary is built around a shocking piece of information: that a performer was so consumed by the need to express himself before an audience that he participated in a horrifying lie. The German Jewish actor and cabaret performer Kurt Gerron was recruited by the Nazis to create a propaganda documentary about Theresienstadt to divert the suspicions of the Red Cross. The footage of Gerron, hard at work constructing his mammoth and monstrous fiction, is one of the most numbing spectacles you're likely to see in a film, nonfiction or otherwise. &quot;A grotesque and shameful lie,&quot; says Ian Holm in voiceover narration, and he also describes the obscene misinformation conjured by the Nazis to hide what was really a concentration camp: &quot;a self-sustaining commune of like-minded people: artists, scientists, craftsmen and entertainers.&quot; &quot;Paradise&quot; eventually posits the notion that Gerron was a lost soul himself; he refuses Peter Lorre's offer to bring him and his family to America because the trip can't be booked in first class. He's so subservient to what he believes his station to be that his life becomes like the operatic tragedies directed by Josef von Sternberg or G. W. Pabst; he's undone by his own hubris, which he finally comes to recognize too late. The story rolls to a recap of the opening moments &#151; the making of the faked film, which a Red Cross observer is invited to see. Gerron's childlike self-absorption makes him an object of pity, and several of the witnesses are forgiving of his behavior. His final fate &#151; he was later shipped to Auschwitz &#151; could be a reason for their attitudes toward him. But the real question posed by &quot;Prisoner of Paradise&quot; &#151; for what price does a man sell his soul, and is it worth it? &#151; is never really answered. That is what a great film often does, but this one seems to just drift to a close instead of pronouncing an end. That can be the result of wrestling with an immense piece of material, and not being up to its demands. &#151; Elvis Mitchell", "multimedia": null}, {"headline": "American Know-How Can't Prevail Nohow", "publication_date": "2003-12-10", "byline": "Stephen Holden", "critics_pick": 1, "date_updated": "2016-03-30 07:09:20", "opening_date": null, "display_title": "Power Trip", "link": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9903E4DA1E3DF933A25751C1A9659C8B63", "suggested_link_text": "Read the New York Times Review of Power Trip", "type": "article"}, "mpaa_rating": "Not Rated", "summary_short": "This superbly balanced and organized documentary about the politics of electricity in the  former Soviet Republic of Georgia portrays a country teetering on the brink of chaos. Its vision is seen largely through the eyes of Piers Lewis, a good-humored British-born  project director for AES-Telasi, the Arlington, Va.-based company that was created in  late 1990's when AES acquired the Georgian power authority, Telasi. At the time, AES  officials had no idea what they were up against. And the story of the company's struggle  to become efficient and profitable in a country where 90 percent of the citizens refused to pay  electricity bills that amounted to half their monthly income plays like an absurdist  political farce. Among the many factors held accountable are globalization, the  corruption of the country's (now-ex) president, Edward Shevardnadze, and the character  of the Georgians themselves. &#151; Stephen Holden", "multimedia": null}], "num_results": 20, "status": "OK", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2017 The New York Times Company.
