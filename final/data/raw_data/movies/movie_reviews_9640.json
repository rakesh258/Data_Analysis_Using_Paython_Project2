And the minor characters are either saints or monsters.

The traffic-stopping cast includes Matt Damon as the dangerous chameleon of the title and, in a star-making role, the English actor Jude Law as a rich dilettante who exerts a homoerotic magnetism. Gwyneth Paltrow plays the odd woman out with the shrewdness of a fine character actress, while Cate Blanchett makes the delirious most of her role as a needy American post-debutante.
