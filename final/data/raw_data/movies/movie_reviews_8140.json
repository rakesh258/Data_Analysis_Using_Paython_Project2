The dazzling, high-flying silliness is quite an achievement:  the movie is better than it deserves to be, given its origins. In fact, there's enough storyline for several movies. The wiry and beauteous tomboy Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) owns a medallion that gets the plot going roughly a scant hour into &quot;Pirates.&quot; The pirate Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) kidnaps Elizabeth because of the medallion, which turns out to be an enchanted piece of gold that can free Barbossa and his swabbies from their curse. They're the larcenous undead whose skeletons can be seen in the moonlight. But the movie belongs to Johnny Depp as the pirate Capt. Jack Sparrow. Gargling his consonants before spitting them out, Mr. Depp suggests a man who has spent either a great deal of time with Keith Richards after a tour of the Rebel Yell factory, or a man who has spent a great deal of time watching Mike Myers do his Keith Richards impression. \u2014 Elvis Mitchell", "multimedia": null}, {"headline": "An Outcast on Fire in Rio's Underworld", "publication_date": "2003-07-09", "byline": "Stephen Holden", "critics_pick": 1, "date_updated": "2016-03-30 07:22:05", "opening_date": null, "display_title": "Madame Sata", "link": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9F01E2DC153DF93AA35754C0A9659C8B63", "suggested_link_text": "Read the New York Times Review of Madame Sata", "type": "article"}, "mpaa_rating": "Not Rated", "summary_short": "Set in the slums of Rio de Janiero in the early 1930's, this film is a portrait of Joao Francisco dos Santos, the legendary black transvestite performer, street fighter, male prostitute and spiritual  acolyte of Josephine Baker, in the formative days of his cabaret career.

Previously, she conquered Harvard Law School, a venue in need of a new world order, and in the nominal sequel, she takes on the moribund legislative branch in Washington. Elle is working as an aide to Representative Rudd (Sally Field), a fellow Delta Nu. Probably the funniest thing in the picture is seeing these Oscar-sized forces of nature: Ms. Witherspoon, the most determined actress of the 21st century, is posed pert nose-to-nose with Ms. Field, whose blurted &quot;You really like me&quot; sentiment disguised a will equally steely. But Charles Herman-Wurmfeld and the writer Kate Kondell don't make enough of this match-up. Instead, &quot;Blonde 2&quot; is repetitive rather than reiterative, going over the same material as the first. The snappy, happy Elle is ridiculed by Rudd's worldly and world-weary aides, especially the tough, crude Grace (Regina King). So, Elle has to wear them down, win them over, yet still find time to get married. The movie assumes not only that Elle did not learn anything from the first movie, but that its lessons of perseverance and open-mindedness were lost on audiences, too. \u2014 Elvis Mitchell", "multimedia": null}, {"headline": "Fill 'Er Up, Please.

This kind of large-scale, epic filmmaking has long been out of style in Hollywood, and it is thrilling to see it revived here. The story, based on the bloody history of 16th-century Thailand, combines palace intrigue and battlefield mayhem, and it shows the central role women played in Thailand's military and political history. The heroine, Suryiothai, is noble and steadfast, but nowhere near as vivid as Srisudachan, a conniving courtesan who rises to power like a Siamese Lady Macbeth, leaving a trail of poisoned and beheaded corpses behind her. \u2014 A.

(As the angry green fellow hops through the desert, pursued by fighter jets, he looks more Claymation than computer-generated, and you half expect to see Wallace and Gromit in the cockpits.) Nor is it the witless writing or the hectic, inconsistent acting. Eric Bana's inertia is overcompensated by the trembling weepiness of Jennifer Connelly, who plays his soul mate, and the raving of Nick Nolte, as his dad, a mad scientist. These lapses would be forgivable if the filmmakers had found the right tone of pop seriousness to bring the hero and his story into focus. They seem to be at once taking the material too seriously and condescending to it, and they are too busy marveling at their own technique to make us care about the sufferings of the Hulk, who is finally not credible at all. \u2014 A.
